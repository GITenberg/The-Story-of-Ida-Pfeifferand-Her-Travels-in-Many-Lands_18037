I.&mdash;HER BIOGRAPHY.</h2>
<p>Ida Pfeiffer, the celebrated traveller, was born in Vienna on the
14th of October 1797.&nbsp; She was the third child of a well-to-do
merchant, named Reyer; and at an early age gave indications of an original
and self-possessed character.&nbsp; The only girl in a family of six
children, her predilections were favoured by the circumstances which
surrounded her.&nbsp; She was bold, enterprising, fond of sport and
exercise; loved to dress like her brothers, and to share in their escapades.&nbsp;
Dolls she contemptuously put aside, preferring drums; and a sword or
a gun was valued at much more than a doll&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; In some
respects her father brought her up strictly; she was fed, <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>like
her brothers, on a simple and even meagre diet, and trained to habits
of prompt obedience; but he did nothing to discourage her taste for
more violent exercises than are commonly permitted to young girls.</p>
<p>She was only in her tenth year, however, when he died; and she then
passed naturally enough under the maternal control.&nbsp; Between her
own inclinations and her mother&rsquo;s ideas of maidenly culture a
great contest immediately arose.&nbsp; Her mother could not understand
why her daughter should prefer the violin to the piano, and the masculine
trousers to the feminine petticoat.&nbsp; In fact, she did not understand
Ida, and it may be assumed that Ida did not understand her.</p>
<p>In 1809 Vienna was captured by the French army under Napoleon; a
disgrace which the brave and spirited Ida felt most keenly.&nbsp; Some
of the victorious troops were quartered in the house of her mother,
who thought it politic to treat them with courtesy; but her daughter
neither could nor would repress her dislike.&nbsp; When compelled to
be present at a grand review which Napoleon held in Sch&ouml;nbrunn,
she turned her back as the emperor rode past.&nbsp; For this hazardous
man&oelig;uvre she was <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>summarily
punished; and to prevent her from repeating it when the emperor returned,
her mother held her by the shoulders.&nbsp; This was of little avail,
however, as Ida perseveringly persisted in keeping her eyes shut.</p>
<p>At the age of thirteen she was induced to resume the garb of her
sex, though it was some time before she could accustom her wild free
movements to it.&nbsp; She was then placed in charge of a tutor, who
seems to have behaved to her with equal skill and delicacy.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
showed,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;great patience and perseverance in combating
my overstrained and misdirected notions.&nbsp; As I had learned to fear
my parents rather than love them, and this gentleman was, so to speak,
the first human being who had displayed any sympathy and affection for
me, I clung to him in return with enthusiastic attachment, desirous
of fulfilling his every wish, and never so happy as when he appeared
satisfied with my exertions.&nbsp; He took the entire charge of my education,
and though it cost me some tears to abandon my youthful visions, and
engage in pursuits I had hitherto regarded with contempt, to all this
I submitted out of my affection for him.&nbsp; I even learned many feminine
avocations, such as sewing, knitting, <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and
cookery.&nbsp; To him I owed the insight I obtained into the duties
and true position of my sex; and it was he who transformed me from a
romp and a hoyden into a modest quiet girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already a great longing for travel had entered into her mind.&nbsp;
She longed to see new scenes, new peoples, new manners and customs.&nbsp;
She read eagerly every book of travel that fell into her hands; followed
with profound interest the career of every adventurous explorer, and
blamed her sex that prevented her from following their heroic examples.&nbsp;
For a while a change was effected in the current of her thoughts by
a strong attachment which sprung up between her and her teacher, who
by this time had given up his former profession, and had obtained an
honourable position in the civil service.&nbsp; It was natural enough
that in the close intimacy which existed between them such an affection
should be developed.&nbsp; Ida&rsquo;s mother, however, regarded it
with grave disapproval, and exacted from the unfortunate girl a promise
that she would neither see nor write to her humble suitor again.&nbsp;
The result was a dangerous illness: on her recovery from which her mother
insisted on her accepting for a husband Dr. Pfeiffer, a widower, with
a grown-up son, but an opulent and <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>distinguished
advocate in Lemberg, who was then on a visit to Vienna.&nbsp; Though
twenty-four years older than Ida, he was attracted by her grace and
simplicity, and offered his hand.&nbsp; Weary of home persecutions,
Ida accepted it, and the marriage took place on May 1st, 1820.</p>
<p>If she did not love her husband, she respected him, and their married
life was not unhappy.&nbsp; In a few months, however, her husband&rsquo;s
integrity led to a sad change of fortune.&nbsp; He had fully and fearlessly
exposed the corruption of the Austrian officials in Galicia, and had
thus made many enemies.&nbsp; He was compelled to give up his office
as councillor, and, deprived of his lucrative practice, to remove to
Vienna in search of employment.&nbsp; Through the treachery of a friend,
Ida&rsquo;s fortune was lost, and the ill-fated couple found themselves
reduced to the most painful exigencies.&nbsp; Vienna, Lemberg, Vienna
again, Switzerland, everywhere Dr. Pfeiffer sought work, and everywhere
found himself baffled by some malignant influence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven
only knows,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer in her autobiography, &ldquo;what
I suffered during eighteen years of my married life; not, indeed, from
any ill-treatment on my husband&rsquo;s part, but from poverty and want.&nbsp;
I came of a <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>wealthy
family, and had been accustomed from my earliest youth to order and
comfort; and now I frequently knew not where I should lay my head, or
find a little money to buy the commonest necessaries.&nbsp; I performed
household drudgery, and endured cold and hunger; I worked secretly for
money, and gave lessons in drawing and music; and yet, in spite of all
my exertions, there were many days when I could hardly put anything
but dry bread before my poor children for their dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These children were two sons, whose education their mother entirely
undertook, until, after old Madame Reyer&rsquo;s death in 1837, she
succeeded to an inheritance, which lifted the little family out of the
slough of poverty, and enabled her to provide her sons with good teachers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>As they grew up and engaged successfully in professional pursuits,
Madame Pfeiffer, who had lost her husband in 1838, found herself once
more under the spell of her old passion for travel, and in a position
to gratify her adventurous inclinations.&nbsp; Her means were somewhat
limited, it is true, for she had done much for her husband and her children;
but economy was natural to her, and she retained the simple habits she
had acquired in her childhood.&nbsp; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>She
was strong, healthy, courageous, and accomplished; and at length, after
maturing her plans with anxious consideration, she took up her pilgrim&rsquo;s
staff, and sallied forth alone.</p>
<p>Her first object was to visit the Holy Land, and tread in the hallowed
footsteps of our Lord.&nbsp; For this purpose she left Vienna on the
22nd of March 1842, and embarked on board the steamer that was to convey
her down the Danube to the Black Sea and the city of Constantinople.&nbsp;
Thence she repaired to Broussa, Beirut, Jaffa, Jerusalem, the Dead Sea,
Nazareth, Damascus, Baalbek, the Lebanon, Alexandria, and Cairo; and
travelled across the sandy Desert to the Isthmus of Suez and the Red
Sea.&nbsp; From Egypt the adventurous lady returned home by way of Sicily
and Italy, visiting Naples, Rome, and Florence, and arriving in Vienna
in December 1842.&nbsp; In the following year she published the record
of her experiences under the title of a &ldquo;Journey of a Viennese
Lady to the Holy Land.&rdquo;&nbsp; It met with a very favourable reception,
to which the simplicity of its style and the faithfulness of its descriptions
fully entitled it.</p>
<p>With the profits of this book to swell her funds, Madame Pfeiffer
felt emboldened to undertake a new <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>expedition;
and this time she resolved on a northern pilgrimage, expecting in <i>Ultima
Thule</i> to see nature manifested on a novel and surprising scale.&nbsp;
She began her journey to Iceland on the 10th of April 1845, and returned
to Vienna on the 4th of October.&nbsp; Her narrative of this second
voyage will be found, necessarily much abridged and condensed, in the
following pages.</p>
<p>What should she do next?&nbsp; Success had increased her courage
and strengthened her resolution, and she could think of nothing fit
for her energies and sufficient for her curiosity but a voyage round
the world!&nbsp; She argued that greater privations and fatigue than
she had endured in Syria and Iceland she could scarcely be called upon
to encounter.&nbsp; The outlay did not frighten her; for she had learned
by experience how little is required, if the traveller will but practise
the strictest economy and resolutely forego many comforts and all superfluities.&nbsp;
Her savings amounted to a sum insufficient, perhaps, for such travellers
as Prince P&uuml;ckler-Muskau, Chateaubriand, or Lamartine for a fortnight&rsquo;s
excursion; but for a woman who wanted to see much, but cared for no
personal indulgence, it seemed enough to last during a journey of two
or three years.&nbsp; And so it proved.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The
heroic woman set out alone on the 1st of May 1846, and proceeded first
to Rio Janeiro.&nbsp; On the 3rd of February 1847, she sailed round
Cape Horn, and on the 2nd of March landed at Valparaiso.&nbsp; Thence
she traversed the broad Pacific to Tahiti, where she was presented to
Queen Pomare.&nbsp; In the beginning of July we find her at Macao; afterwards
she visited Hong Kong and Canton, where the appearance of a white woman
produced a remarkable and rather disagreeable sensation.&nbsp; By way
of Singapore she proceeded to Ceylon, which she carefully explored,
making excursions to Colombo, Candy, and the famous temple of Dagoba.&nbsp;
Towards the end of October she landed at Madras, and thence went on
to Calcutta, ascending the Ganges to the holy city of Benares, and striking
across the country to Bombay.&nbsp; Late in the month of April 1848
she sailed for Persia, and from Bushire traversed the interior as far
as legend-haunted Bagdad.&nbsp; After a pilgrimage to the ruins of Ctesiphon
and Babylon, this bold lady accompanied a caravan through the dreary
desert to Mosul and the vast ruins of Nineveh, and afterwards to the
salt lake of Urumiyeh and the city of Tabreez.&nbsp; It is certain that
no woman ever accomplished a more daring <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>exploit!&nbsp;
The mental as well as physical energy required was enormous; and only
a strong mind and a strong frame could have endured the many hardships
consequent on her undertaking&mdash;the burning heat by day, the inconveniences
of every kind at night, the perils incidental to her sex, meagre fare,
a filthy couch, and constant apprehension of attack by robber bands.&nbsp;
The English consul at Tabreez, when she introduced herself to him, found
it hard to believe that a woman could have accomplished such an enterprise.</p>
<p>At Tabreez, Madame Pfeiffer was presented to the Viceroy, and obtained
permission to visit his harem.&nbsp; On August 11th, 1848, she resumed
her journey, crossing Armenia, Georgia, and Mingrelia; she touched afterwards
at Anapa, Kertch, and Sebastopol, landed at Odessa, and returned home
by way of Constantinople, Greece, the Ionian Islands, and Trieste, arriving
in Vienna on the 4th of November 1848, just after the city had been
recaptured from the rebels by the troops of Prince Windischgr&auml;tz.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Ida Pfeiffer was now a woman of note.&nbsp; Her name was known in
every civilized country; and it was not unnatural that great celebrity
should <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>
attach to a female who, alone, and without the protection of rank or
official recommendation, had travelled 2800 miles by land, and 35,000
miles by sea.&nbsp; Hence, her next work, &ldquo;A Woman&rsquo;s Journey
Round the World,&rdquo; was most favourably received, and translated
both into French and English.&nbsp; A summary of it is included in our
little volume.</p>
<p>The brave adventurer at first, on her return home, spoke of her travelling
days as over, and, at the age of fifty-four, as desirous of peace and
rest.&nbsp; But this tranquil frame of mind was of very brief duration.&nbsp;
Her love of action and thirst of novelty could not long be repressed;
and as she felt herself still strong and healthy, with energies as quick
and lively as ever, she resolved on a second circuit of the globe.&nbsp;
Her funds having been increased by a grant of 1500 florins from the
Austrian Government, she left Vienna on the 18th of March 1851, proceeded
to London, and thence to Cape Town, where she arrived on the 11th of
August.&nbsp; For a while she hesitated between a visit to the interior
of Africa and a voyage to Australia; but at last she sailed to Singapore,
and determined to explore the East Indian Archipelago.&nbsp; At Sarawak,
the British settlement in Borneo, she was warmly <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>welcomed
by Sir James Brooke, a man of heroic temper and unusual capacities for
command and organization.&nbsp; She adventured among the Dyaks, and
journeyed westward to Pontianak, and the diamond mines of Landak.&nbsp;
We next meet with her in Java, and afterwards in Sumatra, where she
boldly trusted herself among the cannibal Battas, who had hitherto resented
the intrusion of any European.&nbsp; Returning to Java, she saw almost
all that it had of natural wonders or natural beauties; and then departed
on a tour through the Sunda Islands and the Moluccas, visiting Banda,
Amboyna, Ceram, Ternate, and Celebes.</p>
<p>For a second time she traversed the Pacific, but on this occasion
in an opposite direction.&nbsp; For two months she saw no land; but
on the 27th September 1853 she arrived at San Francisco.&nbsp; At the
close of the year she sailed for Callao.&nbsp; Thence she repaired to
Lima, with the intention of crossing the Andes, and pushing eastward,
through the interior of South America, to the Brazilian coast.&nbsp;
A revolution in Peru, however, compelled her to change her course, and
she returned to Ecuador, which served as a starting-point for her ascent
of the Cordilleras.&nbsp; After having the good fortune <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to
witness an eruption of Cotopaxi, she retraced her steps to the west.&nbsp;
In the neighbourhood of Guayaquil she had two very narrow escapes: one,
by a fall from her mule; and next, by an immersion in the River Guaya,
which teems with alligators.&nbsp; Meeting with neither courtesy nor
help from the Spanish Americans&mdash;a superstitious, ignorant, and
degraded race&mdash;she gladly set sail for Panama.</p>
<p>At the end of May she crossed the Isthmus, and sailed to New Orleans.&nbsp;
Thence she ascended the Mississippi to Napoleon, and the Arkansas to
Fort Smith.&nbsp; After suffering from a severe attack of fever, she
made her way to St. Louis, and then directed her steps northward to
St. Paul, the Falls of St. Antony, Chicago, and thence to the great
Lakes and &ldquo;mighty Niagara.&rdquo;&nbsp; After an excursion into
Canada, she visited New York, Boston, and other great cities, crossed
the Atlantic, and arrived in England on the 21st of November 1854.&nbsp;
Two years later she published a narrative of her adventures, entitled
&ldquo;My Second Journey Round the World.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s last voyage was to Madagascar, and will be
found described in the closing chapter of this little volume.&nbsp;
In Madagascar she contracted <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>a
dangerous illness, from which she temporarily recovered; but on her
return to Europe it was evident that her constitution had received a
severe blow.&nbsp; She gradually grew weaker.&nbsp; Her disease proved
to be cancer of the liver, and the physicians pronounced it incurable.&nbsp;
After lingering a few weeks in much pain, she passed away on the night
of the 27th of October 1858, in the sixty-third year of her age.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>This remarkable woman is described as of short stature, thin, and
slightly bent.&nbsp; Her movements were deliberate and measured.&nbsp;
She was well-knit and of considerable physical energy, and her career
proves her to have been possessed of no ordinary powers of endurance.&nbsp;
The reader might probably suppose that she was what is commonly known
as a strong-minded woman.&nbsp; The epithet would suit her if seriously
applied, for she had undoubtedly a clear, strong intellect, a cool judgment,
and a resolute purpose; but it would be thoroughly inapplicable in the
satirical sense in which it is commonly used.&nbsp; There was nothing
masculine about her.&nbsp; On the contrary, she was so reserved and
so unassuming that it required an intimate knowledge of her to fathom
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>the
depths of her acquirements and experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;In her whole
appearance and manner,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;was a staidness that
seemed to indicate the practical housewife, with no thought soaring
beyond her domestic concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This quiet, silent woman, travelled nearly 20,000 miles by land and
150,000 miles by sea; visiting regions which no European had previously
penetrated, or where the bravest men had found it difficult to make
their way; undergoing a variety of severe experiences; opening up numerous
novel and surprising scenes; and doing all this with the scantiest means,
and unassisted by powerful protection or royal patronage.&nbsp; We doubt
whether the entire round of human enterprise presents anything more
remarkable or more admirable.&nbsp; And it would be unfair to suppose
that she was actuated only by a feminine curiosity.&nbsp; Her leading
motive was a thirst for knowledge.&nbsp; At all events, if she had a
passion for travelling, it must be admitted that her qualifications
as a traveller were unusual.&nbsp; Her observation was quick and accurate;
her perseverance was indefatigable; her courage never faltered; while
she possessed a peculiar talent for first awakening, and then profiting
by, the interest and <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>sympathy
of those with whom she came in contact.</p>
<p>To assert that her travels were wholly without scientific value would
be unjust; Humboldt and Carl Ritter were of a different opinion.&nbsp;
She made her way into regions which had never before been trodden by
European foot; and the very fact of her sex was a frequent protection
in her most dangerous undertakings.&nbsp; She was allowed to enter many
places which would have been rigorously barred against male travellers.&nbsp;
Consequently, her communications have the merit of embodying many new
facts in geography and ethnology, and of correcting numerous popular
errors.&nbsp; Science derived much benefit also from her valuable collections
of plants, animals, and minerals.</p>
<p>We conclude with the eulogium pronounced by an anonymous biographer:&mdash;&ldquo;Straightforward
in character, and endued with high principle, she possessed, moreover,
a wisdom and a promptitude in action seldom equalled among her sex.&nbsp;
Ida Pfeiffer may, indeed, justly be classed among those women who richly
compensate for the absence of outward charms by their remarkable energy
and the rare qualities of their minds.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>CHAPTER
II.&mdash;JOURNEY ROUND THE WORLD.</h2>
<p>Prompted by a boundless thirst for knowledge and an insatiable desire
to see new places and new things, Madame Pfeiffer left Vienna on the
1st of May 1846, and proceeded to Hamburg, where she embarked on board
a Danish brig, the <i>Caroline</i>, for Rio Janeiro.&nbsp; As the voyage
was divested of romantic incidents, we shall land the reader without
delay at the great sea-port of the Brazilian empire.</p>
<p>The traveller&rsquo;s description of it is not very favourably coloured.&nbsp;
The streets are dirty, and the houses, even the public buildings, insignificant.&nbsp;
The Imperial Palace has not the slightest architectural pretensions.&nbsp;
The finest square is the Largo do Roico, but this would not be admitted
into Belgravia.&nbsp; It is impossible to speak in high terms <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>even
of the churches, the interior of which is not less disappointing than
their exterior.&nbsp; And as is the town, so are the inhabitants.&nbsp;
Negroes and mulattoes do not make up attractive pictures.&nbsp; Some
of the Brazilian and Portuguese women, however, have handsome and expressive
countenances.</p>
<p>Most writers indulge in glowing descriptions of the scenery and climate
of the Brazils; of the cloudless, radiant sky, and the magic of the
never-ending spring.&nbsp; Madame Ida Pfeiffer admits that the vegetation
is richer, and the soil more fruitful, and nature more exuberantly active
than in any other part of the world; but still, she says, it must not
be thought that all is good and beautiful, and that there is nothing
to weaken the powerful effect of the first impression.&nbsp; The constant
blaze of colour after a while begins to weary; the eye wants rest; the
monotony of the verdure oppresses; and we begin to understand that the
true loveliness of spring is only rightly appreciated when it succeeds
the harsher aspects of winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page33.jpg">
<img alt="Invasion of Ants" src="images/page33.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Europeans suffer much from the climate.&nbsp; The moisture is very
considerable, and renders the heat, which in the hot months rises to
99&deg; in the shade, and 122&deg; in the sun, more difficult to bear.&nbsp;
Fogs <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and
mists are disagreeably common; and whole tracts of country are often
veiled by an impenetrable mist.</p>
<p>The Brazils suffer, too, from a plague of insects,&mdash;from mosquitoes,
ants, baraten, and sand-fleas; against the attacks of which the traveller
finds it difficult to defend himself.&nbsp; The ants often appear in
trains of immeasurable length, and pursue their march over every obstacle
that stands in the way.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer, during her residence
at a friend&rsquo;s house, beheld the advance of a swarm of this description.&nbsp;
It was really interesting to see what a regular line they formed; nothing
could make them deviate from the direction on which they had first determined.&nbsp;
Madame Geiger, her friend, told her she was awakened one night by a
terrible itching: she sprang out of bed immediately, and lo, a swarm
of ants were passing over it!&nbsp; There is no remedy for the infliction,
except to wait, with as much patience as one can muster, for the end
of the procession, which frequently lasts four to six hours.&nbsp; It
is possible, to some extent, to protect provisions against their attacks,
by placing the legs of the tables in basins filled with water.&nbsp;
Clothes and linen are enclosed in tightly-fitting tin canisters.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>The
worst plague of all, however, are the sand-fleas, which attach themselves
to one&rsquo;s toes, underneath the nail, or sometimes to the soles
of the feet.&nbsp; When a person feels an irritation in these parts,
he must immediately look at the place; and if he discern a tiny black
point, surrounded by a small white ring, the former is the <i>chigoe</i>,
or sand-flea, and the latter the eggs which it has deposited in the
flesh.&nbsp; The first thing to be done is to loosen the skin all round
as far as the white skin is visible; the whole deposit is then extracted,
and a little snuff strewn in the empty space.&nbsp; The blacks perform
this operation with considerable skill.</p>
<p>Rich as the Brazils are in natural productions, they are wanting
in many articles which Europeans regard as of the first importance.&nbsp;
There are sugar and coffee, it is true; but no corn, no potatoes, and
none of our delightful varieties of fruit.&nbsp; The flour of manioc,
obtained from the cassava plant, which forms a staple portion of almost
every dish, supplies the place of bread, but is far from being so nutritious
and strengthening; while the different kinds of sweet-tasting roots
are far inferior in value to our potato.&nbsp; The only fruit which
Madame Pfeiffer thought really excellent, were the oranges, bananas,
<!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and
mangoes.&nbsp; The pine-apples are neither very sweet nor very fragrant.&nbsp;
And with regard to two most important articles of consumption, the milk
is very watery, and the meat very dry.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Our traveller, during her sojourn at Rio Janeiro, made many interesting
excursions in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; One was directed to Petropolis,
a colony founded by Germans in the heart of scenery of the most exquisite
character.&nbsp; Accompanied by Count Berchthold, she sailed for Porto
d&rsquo;Estrella in one of the regular coasting barks.&nbsp; Their course
carried them across a bay remarkable for its picturesque views.&nbsp;
It lies calmly in the embrace of richly-wooded hills, and is studded
with islands, like a silver shield with emerald bosses.&nbsp; Some of
these islands are completely overgrown with palms, while others are
masses of huge rock, with a carpet of green turf.</p>
<p>Their bark was manned by four negroes and a white skipper.&nbsp;
At first they ran merrily before a favourable wind, but in two hours
the crew were compelled to take to the oars, the method of using which
was exceedingly fatiguing.&nbsp; At each dip of the oar, the rower mounts
upon a bench in front of <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>him,
and then, during the stroke, throws himself off again, with his full
force.&nbsp; In two hours more they passed into the river Geromerino,
and made their way through a world of beautiful aquatic plants which
covered the tranquil waters in every direction.&nbsp; The river banks
are flat, and fringed with underwood and young trees; the background
is formed by ranges of low green hills.</p>
<p>At Porto d&rsquo;Estrella, Madame Pfeiffer and her companion landed,
and proceeded on foot towards Petropolis.&nbsp; The first eight miles
lay through a broad valley, clothed with dense brambles and young trees,
and shadowed by lofty mountains.&nbsp; The wild pine-apples by the roadside
were very fair to see; they were not quite ripe, but tinted of the most
delicate red.&nbsp; Beautiful humming-birds flashed through the air
like &ldquo;winged jewels,&rdquo; and studded the dense foliage with
points of many-coloured light.</p>
<p>After passing through the valley, they reached the Sierra, as the
Brazilians term the practicable mountain-summits.&nbsp; It was three
thousand feet in height, and was ascended by a broad paved road, striking
through the depths of virgin forests.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer had always imagined that the trees in virgin forests
had very thick and lofty <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>trunks;
but such was not the case here; probably because the vegetation was
too luxuriant, and the larger trunks have the life crushed out of them
by masses of smaller trees, bushes, creepers, and parasites.</p>
<p>Frequent truppas, or teams of ten mules driven by a negro, as well
as numerous pedestrians, enlivened the path, and prevented our travellers
from observing that their steps were persistently followed up by a negro.&nbsp;
When, however, they arrived at a somewhat lonely spot, this negro suddenly
sprang forward, holding a lasso in one hand and a long knife in the
other, and with threatening gestures gave them to understand that he
intended to murder them, and then drag their dead bodies into the forest!</p>
<p>The travellers were without arms, having been told the road was perfectly
safe; their only weapons were their umbrellas, with the exception of
a clasp-knife.&nbsp; This the brave woman drew from her pocket and opened,
in the calm resolution to sell her life as dearly as possible.&nbsp;
With their umbrellas they parried their adversary&rsquo;s blows as long
as they could; but he caught hold of Madame Ida&rsquo;s, which snapped
off, leaving only a piece of the handle in her <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>hand.&nbsp;
In the struggle, however, he dropped his knife, which rolled a few steps
away from him.&nbsp; Madame Ida immediately made a dash at it, and thought
she had secured it; but, quicker in his movements than she was, he thrust
her away with his hands and feet, and once more obtained possession
of it.&nbsp; Waving it furiously over his head, he slashed her twice
in the upper part of the left arm.&nbsp; All seemed lost; but in her
extreme peril the brave lady bethought her of her own knife, and struck
at her adversary, wounding him in the hand.&nbsp; At the same moment
Count Berchthold sprang forward, and while he seized the villain with
both arms, Madame Ida Pfeiffer recovered her feet.&nbsp; All this took
place in less than a minute.&nbsp; The negro was now roused into a condition
of maniacal fury; he gnashed his teeth like a wild beast, and brandished
his knife, while uttering fearful threats.&nbsp; The issue of the contest
would probably have been disastrous, but for the opportune arrival of
assistance.&nbsp; Hearing the tramp of horses&rsquo; hoofs upon the
road, the negro desisted from his attack, and sprang into the forest.&nbsp;
A couple of horsemen turning the corner of the road, our travellers
hurried to meet them; and having told their tale, which, indeed, their
wounds told <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>eloquently
enough, they leaped from their horses, and entered the wood in pursuit.&nbsp;
A couple of negroes soon afterwards coming up, the villain was captured,
securely pinioned, and, as he would not walk, severely beaten, until,
as most of the blows fell upon his head, Madame Ida Pfeiffer feared
that the wretch&rsquo;s skull would be broken.&nbsp; Nothing, however,
would induce him to walk, and the negroes were compelled to carry him
bodily, to the nearest house.</p>
<p>The colony of Petropolis proved to be situated in the depth of a
virgin forest, at an elevation of 2500 feet above the sea-level.&nbsp;
At the time of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit it was about fourteen months
old, having been founded for the special purpose of providing the capital
with fruits and vegetables which, in tropical climates, will thrive
only in very elevated situations.&nbsp; It was, of course, in a very
rudimentary condition, the mere embryo of a town; but the country around
it was very picturesque.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s second excursion was into the interior; and
it opened up to her a variety of interesting scenes,&mdash;as, for instance,
a manioc-fazenda, or plantation.&nbsp; The manioc plant, it appears,
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>throws
off stalks from four to six feet in height, with a number of large leaves
at their upper extremities.&nbsp; The valuable portion of the plant
is its bulbous root, which frequently weighs two or three pounds, and
supplies the place of corn throughout the Brazils.&nbsp; It is washed,
peeled, and held against the rough edge of a mill-stone, until it is
completely ground into flour.&nbsp; This flour is collected in a basket,
steeped thoroughly in water, and afterwards pressed quite dry by means
of a press.&nbsp; Lastly, it is scattered upon large iron plates, and
slowly dried over a gentle fire.&nbsp; At this stage it resembles a
very coarse kind of flour, and is eaten in two ways;&mdash;either mixed
with hot water, until it forms a kind of porridge; or baked in the form
of coarse flour, which is handed round at table in little baskets.</p>
<p>She also saw a coffee plantation.&nbsp; The coffee-trees stand in
rows upon tolerably steep hillocks.&nbsp; Their height ranges from six
feet to twelve; and they begin to bear sometimes as early as the second,
but in no case later than the third year.&nbsp; They are productive
for at least ten years.&nbsp; The leaf is long and slightly serrated,
and the flower white; while the fruit hangs down like a cluster of grapes,
and resembles a large cherry, which varies from green to <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>red,
then to brown, and almost black.&nbsp; While red, the outer shell is
soft; but eventually it becomes perfectly hard, until it may be compared
to a wooden capsule.&nbsp; Blossoms and ripe fruit are found on the
same tree at the same time; so that a crop may be gathered at almost
any season of the year.&nbsp; After the berries are plucked, they are
spread out in spacious areas enclosed by a wall about twelve feet high,
with small drains to carry off the rain-water.&nbsp; Here the coffee
is allowed to dry in the heat of the sun, and it is then shaken into
large stone mortars, where it is lightly pounded with wooden hammers,
set in motion by water power.&nbsp; The whole mass falls into wooden
boxes attached to a long table, at which sit the negro workers, who
separate the coffee from the husk, and put it into flat copper pans.&nbsp;
In these it is carefully and skilfully turned about over a slow fire,
until desiccation is complete.&nbsp; On the whole, says Madame Ida Pfeiffer,
the preparation of the coffee is not laborious, and the harvest much
more easily gathered than one of corn.&nbsp; The negro, while plucking
the coffee, stands erect, and the tree protects him from the heat of
the sun.&nbsp; His only danger is from poisonous snakes, and a sting
from one of these is a very rare occurrence.</p>
<p><!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Another
novelty which much impressed our traveller was the sight of the frequent
burning forests.&nbsp; These are set on fire in order to clear the ground
for cultivation.&nbsp; In most cases she viewed the tremendous spectacle
from a distance; but one day she realized it in all its details, as
her road lay between a wood in flames on the one hand, and the brushwood,
crackling and seething, on the other.&nbsp; The space between the double
rows of fire did not exceed fifty paces in breadth, and was completely
buried in smoke.&nbsp; The spluttering and hissing of the fire was distinctly
audible, and through the dense mass of vapour shot upward thick shafts
and tongues of flame, while now and then the large trees crashed to
the ground, with loud reports, like those of artillery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page45.jpg">
<img alt="A Forest of Fire" src="images/page45.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;On seeing my guide enter this fiery gulf,&rdquo; says our
traveller, &ldquo;I was, I must confess, rather frightened;&rdquo; and
her dread was surely very excusable.&nbsp; She plucked up courage, however,
when she saw that her guide pushed forward.&nbsp; On the threshold,
so to speak, sat two negroes, to indicate the safe, and, in truth, the
only path.&nbsp; The guide, in obedience to their warning, spurred on
his mule, and, followed by Madame Pfeiffer, galloped at full speed across
the desert of fire.&nbsp; Flames to the right of them, flames to the
left of them, onward they dashed, and happily effected the passage in
safety.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Madame
Pfeiffer gives a bright description of the beauties of the road as she
pushed further into the interior.&nbsp; Crossing a small waterfall,
she struck right into the depths of the virgin forest, pursuing a narrow
path which ran along the bank of a little stream.&nbsp; Palms, with
their lordly crests, soared high above the other trees, which, intertwined
by inextricable boughs, formed the loveliest fairy-bowers imaginable;
every stem, every branch was luxuriously festooned with fantastic orchids;
while creepers and ferns glided up the tall, smooth trunks, mingling
with the boughs, and hanging in every direction waving curtains of flowers,
of the sweetest odours and the most vivid colours.&nbsp; With shrill
twittering cry and rapid wings flashed the humming-bird from bough to
bough; the pepper-pecker, with glowing plumage, soared timorously upwards;
while parrots and paroquets, and innumerable birds of beautiful appearance,
added, by their cries and motions, to the liveliness of the scene.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer visited an Indian village.&nbsp; It lay <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>deep
in the forest recesses, and consisted of five huts, or rather sheds,
formed of leaves, and measuring eighteen feet by twelve feet, erected
under lofty trees.&nbsp; The frames were formed of four poles stuck
in the ground, with another reaching across; and the roof was wrought
of palm-leaves, by no means impervious to the rain.&nbsp; The sides
were open.&nbsp; In the interior hung a hammock or two; and on the earth
a few roots, Indian corn, and bananas were roasting under a heap of
ashes.&nbsp; In one corner, under the roof, a small supply of provisions
was hoarded up, and round about were scattered a few gourds; these are
used by the Puris as substitutes for &ldquo;crockery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their
weapons, the long bows and arrows, leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer describes the Puri Indians as even uglier than the
negroes.&nbsp; Their complexion is a light bronze; they are stunted
in stature, well-knit, and about the middle size.&nbsp; Their features
are broad and somewhat compressed; their hair is thick, long, and of
a coal-black colour.&nbsp; The men wear it hanging straight down; the
women, in plaits fastened to the back of the head, and sometimes falling
loosely down about their persons.&nbsp; Their forehead is broad and
low, and the nose somewhat flattened; the eyes are <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>long
and narrow, almost like those of the Chinese; and the mouth is large,
with rather thick lips.&nbsp; To enhance the effect of these various
charms, the countenance bears a peculiar look of stupidity, which may
be attributed perhaps to the way in which the mouth is kept always open.&nbsp;
Women, as well as males, are generally tattooed of a reddish or blue
colour, round the mouth, moustachio-wise.&nbsp; Both sexes are addicted
to smoking, and look upon brandy as the <i>summum bonum</i> of human
life.</p>
<p>The Indians, ugly as they were, gave Madame Pfeiffer a hospitable
welcome.&nbsp; After an evening meal, in which roasted monkey and parrot
were the chief dishes, they performed one of their characteristic dances.&nbsp;
A quantity of wood was heaped up into a funeral pile, and set on fire;
the men then danced around it in a ring.&nbsp; They threw their bodies
from side to side with much awkwardness, but always moving the head
forward in a straight line.&nbsp; The women then joined in, forming
at a short distance behind the men, and imitating all their movements.&nbsp;
A horrible noise arose; this was intended for a song, the singers at
the same time distorting their features frightfully.&nbsp; One of them
performed on a kind of stringed instrument, made out of the stem of
a <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>cabbage-palm,
and about two feet, or two feet and a half, in length.&nbsp; A hole
was cut in it slantwise, and six fibres of the stem were kept up in
an elevated position at each end, by means of a small bridge.&nbsp;
The fingers played upon these as upon a guitar, drawing forth a very
low, harsh, and disagreeable tone.&nbsp; The dance, thus pleasingly
accompanied, was called the Dance of Peace and Joy.</p>
<p>A wilder measure was next undertaken by the men alone.&nbsp; They
first equipped themselves with bows, arrows, and stout clubs; then they
formed a circle, indulged in the most rapid and fantastic movements,
and brandished their clubs as if dealing death to a hundred foes.&nbsp;
Suddenly they broke their ranks, strung their bows, placed their arrows
ready, and represented all the evolutions of shooting after a flying
foe, giving utterance to the most piercing cries, which resounded through
the forest-glades.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer, believing that she was really
surrounded by enemies, started up in terror, and was heartily glad when
the dance ended.</p>

<img alt="Cape Horn" src="images/page51.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>From Rio Janeiro Madame Pfeiffer sailed in an English ship, the <i>John
Renwick</i>, on the 9th of December, bound for Valparaiso in Chili.&nbsp;
She kept to the south, touching at Santos, where the voyagers <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>celebrated
New-Year&rsquo;s Day, and reaching the mouth of the Rio Plata on the
11th of January.&nbsp; In these latitudes the Southern Cross is the
most conspicuous object in the heavens.&nbsp; It consists of four stars
of much brilliancy, arranged in two diagonal rows.&nbsp; Late in the
month the voyagers sighted the sterile shores and barren mountains of
Patagonia, and next the volcanic rocks, wave-worn and wind-worn, of
Tierra del Fuego.&nbsp; Through the Strait of Le Maire, which separates
the latter from Staten Island, they sailed onward to the extreme southern
point of the American continent, the famous promontory of Cape Horn.&nbsp;
It is the termination of the mighty mountain-chain of the Andes, and
is formed of a mass of colossal basaltic rocks, thrown together in wild
disorder, as by a Titan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Rounding Cape Horn they encountered a violent gale, which lasted
for several days; and soon discovered, like other voyagers, how little
the great southern ocean deserves its name of the Pacific.&nbsp; But
they reached Valparaiso in safety.&nbsp; Its appearance, however, did
not very favourably impress Madame Ida Pfeiffer.&nbsp; It is laid out
in two long streets at the foot of dreary hills, these hills consisting
of a pile of rocks covered with thin strata of earth and <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>sand.&nbsp;
Some of them are covered with houses; on one of them is the churchyard;
the others are bare and solitary.&nbsp; The two chief streets are broad,
and much frequented, especially by horsemen; for every Chilian is born
a horseman, and is usually mounted on a steed worthy of a good rider.</p>
<p>Valparaiso houses are European in style, with flat Italian roofs.&nbsp;
Broad steps lead up into a lofty entrance-hall on the first floor, from
which, through large glass doors, the visitor passes into the drawing-room
and other apartments.&nbsp; The drawing-room is the pride not only of
every European settler, but of every native Chilian.&nbsp; The foot
sinks into heavy and costly carpets; the walls are emblazoned with rich
tapestry; the furniture and mirrors are of European make, and sumptuous
in the extreme; and every table presents the evidence of refined taste
in gorgeous albums, adorned with the choicest engravings.</p>
<p>As to the lower classes of the population, if we would obtain an
idea of their manners and customs, we must stroll on a f&ecirc;te-day
into one of their eating-houses.</p>
<p>In one corner, on the ground, crackles a tremendous fire, surrounded
by innumerable pots and pans, <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>between
which are wooden spits with beef and pork, simmering and roasting with
appetizing savour.&nbsp; A rude wooden frame-work, with a long broad
plank on it, occupies the middle of the room, and is covered with a
cloth, the original colour of which it is impossible to determine.&nbsp;
This is the guest-table.&nbsp; The dinner is served up in the most primitive
fashion imaginable, all the viands being heaped up in one dish; beans
and rice, potatoes and roast beef, onions and paradise apples, forming
a curious medley.&nbsp; The appetites of the guests are keen, and no
time is wasted in talking.&nbsp; At the end of the repast, a goblet
of wine or water passes from hand to hand; after which every tongue
is loosened.&nbsp; In the evening a guitar strikes up, and dancing becomes
general.</p>
<p>A singular custom prevails among the Chilians on the death of a little
child.&nbsp; This incident, in most European families, is attended by
much sorrow: the Chilian parents make it the occasion of a great festival.&nbsp;
The deceased <i>angelito</i>, or little angel, is adorned in various
ways.&nbsp; Its eyes, instead of being closed, are opened as wide as
possible; its cheeks are painted red; then the cold rigid corpse is
dressed in the finest clothes, crowned with flowers, and set up in a
little chair in a flower-garlanded niche.&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>The
relatives and neighbours flock in, to wish the parents joy on the possession
of such an angel; and, during the first night, they all indulge in the
most extravagant dances, and feast with sounds of wildest merriment
before the <i>angelito</i>.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer heard from a merchant the following story:&mdash;A
grave-digger, on his way to the churchyard with one of these deceased
angelitos, tarried at a tavern to refresh himself with a cup of wine.&nbsp;
The landlord inquired what he was carrying under his cloak, and on learning
that it was an angelito, offered him a shilling for it.&nbsp; A bargain
was soon struck; the landlord quickly fitted up a flowery niche in the
drinking-saloon, and then took care that his neighbours should know
what a treasure he had acquired.&nbsp; They came; they admired the angelito;
they drank copiously in its honour.&nbsp; But the parents hearing of
the affair, interfered, carried away their dead child, and summoned
the landlord before the magistrate.&nbsp; The latter gravely heard the
pleadings on both sides, and as no such case was mentioned in the statute-book,
arranged it amicably, to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>

</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Wearying of Valparaiso, our restless and adventurous <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>traveller,
who was bent upon accomplishing a voyage round the world, took her passage
for China in the Dutch barque <i>Lootpurt</i>, Captain Van Wyk Jurianse.</p>
<p>They sailed from Valparaiso on the 18th of March, and on the 26th
of April came in sight of that gem of the South Seas, Tahiti, the Otaheite
of Captain Cook, and the largest and most beautiful of the Society group.&nbsp;
From the days of Bougainville, its discoverer, down to those of &ldquo;the
Earl and the Doctor,&rdquo; who recently published a narrative of their
visit, it has been the theme of admiration for the charms of its scenery.&nbsp;
It lifts its lofty summit out of a wealth of luxuriant vegetation, which
descends to the very margin of a sea as blue as the sky above it.&nbsp;
Cool green valleys penetrate into its mountain-recesses, and their slopes
are loaded with groves of bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees.&nbsp; The
inhabitants, physically speaking, are not unworthy of their island-Eden;
they are a tall, robust, and well-knit race, and would be comely but
for their custom of flattening the nose as soon as the child is born.&nbsp;
They have fine dark eyes, and thick jet-black hair.&nbsp; The colour
of their skin is a copper-brown.&nbsp; Both sexes are tattooed, generally
from the hips half down the <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>legs,
and frequently over the hands, feet, and other parts of the body; the
devices being often very fanciful in design, and always artistically
executed.</p>
<p>The women of Tahiti have always been notorious for their immodesty,
and the island, notwithstanding the labours of zealous missionaries,
continues to be the Polynesian Paphos.&nbsp; The French protectorate
from which it suffers has not raised the moral standard of the population.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer undertook an excursion to the Lake Vaihiria, assuming
for the nonce a semi-masculine attire, which any less strong-minded
and adventurous woman would probably have refused.&nbsp; She wore, she
tells us, strong men&rsquo;s shoes, trousers, and a blouse, which was
fastened high up about the hips.&nbsp; Thus equipped, she started off
with her guide, crossing about two-and-thirty brooks before they entered
the ravines leading into the interior of the island.</p>
<p>She noticed that as they advanced the fruit-trees disappeared, and
instead, the slopes were covered with plantains, taros, and marantas;
the last attaining a height of twelve feet, and growing so luxuriantly
that it is with some difficulty the traveller makes his way through
the tangle.&nbsp; The taro, which <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>is
carefully cultivated, averages two or three feet high, and has fine
large leaves and tubers like those of the potato, but not so good when
roasted.&nbsp; There is much gracefulness in the appearance of the plantain,
or banana, which varies from twelve to fifteen feet in height, and has
leaves like those of the palm, but a brittle reed-like stem, about eight
inches in diameter.&nbsp; It attains its full growth in the first year,
bears fruit in the second, and then dies.&nbsp; Thus its life is as
brief as it is useful.</p>
<p>Through one bright mountain-stream, which swept along the ravine
over a stony bed, breaking up into eddies and tiny whirlpools, and in
some places attaining a depth of three feet, Madame Pfeiffer and her
guide waded or half-swam two-and-sixty times.&nbsp; The resolute spirit
of the woman, however, never failed her; and though the path at every
step became more difficult and dangerous, she persisted in pressing
forward.&nbsp; She clambered over rocks and stones; she forced her way
through inter-tangled bushes; and though severely wounded in her hands
and feet, never hesitated for a moment.&nbsp; In two places the ravine
narrowed so considerably that the entire space was filled by the brawling
torrent.&nbsp; It was here that the islanders, during <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>their
struggle against French occupation, threw up stone walls five feet in
height, as a barrier against the enemy.</p>
<p>In eight hours the bold traveller and her guide had walked, waded,
and clambered fully eighteen miles, and had attained an elevation of
eighteen hundred feet.&nbsp; The lake itself was not visible until they
stood upon its shores, as it lies bosomed in a deep hollow, among lofty
and precipitous mountains which descend with startling abruptness to
the very brink of its dark, deep waters.&nbsp; To cross the lake it
is necessary to put one&rsquo;s trust in one&rsquo;s swimming powers,
or in a curiously frail kind of boat, which the natives prepare with
equal rapidity and skill.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer, however, was nothing
if not adventurous.&nbsp; Whatever there was to be dared, she immediately
dared.&nbsp; At her request, the guide made the usual essay at boat-building.&nbsp;
He tore off some plantain branches, bound them together with long tough
grass, laid a few leaves upon them, launched them in the water, and
requested Madame Pfeiffer to embark.&nbsp; She confesses to having felt
a little hesitation, but without saying a word, she stepped on board.&nbsp;
Then her guide took to the water like a duck, and pushed her forward.&nbsp;
The passage <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>across
the lake, and back again, was in this way accomplished without any accident.</p>
<p>Having satiated herself with admiring the lake and its surrounding
scenery, she retired to a little nook roofed over with leaves, where
her guide quickly kindled a good fire in the usual Indian fashion.&nbsp;
He cut a small piece of wood to a fine point, and then selecting a second
piece, grooved it with a narrow and not very deep furrow.&nbsp; In this
he rubbed the pointed stick until the fragments detached during the
process began to smoke.&nbsp; These he flung into a heap of dry leaves
and grass previously collected, and swung the whole several times round
in the air, until it broke out into flames.&nbsp; The entire process
did not occupy above two minutes.&nbsp; Gathering a few plantains, these
were roasted for supper; after which Madame Pfeiffer withdrew to her
solitary couch of dry leaves, to sleep as best she might.&nbsp; It is
impossible not to wonder at the marvellous physical capability of this
adventurous woman, no less than at her courage, her resolution, and
her perseverance.&nbsp; How many of her sex could bear for a week the
fatigue and exposure to which she subjected herself year after year?</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The
next morning she accomplished the return journey in safety.</p>

<img alt="Hong-Kong" src="images/page65.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On the 17th of May she left Tahiti, the Dutch vessel in which she
had embarked being bound via the Philippines.&nbsp; They passed this
rich and radiant group of islands on the 1st of July, and the next day
entered the dangerous China Sea.&nbsp; A few days afterwards they reached
Hong-Kong, which has been an English settlement since 1842.&nbsp; Here
Madame Pfeiffer made no long stay, for she desired to see China and
the Chinese with as little intermixture of the European element as possible.&nbsp;
So she ascended the Pearl river, the banks of which are covered with
immense plantations of rice, and studded with quaint little country-houses,
of the genuine Chinese pattern, with sloping, pointed roofs, and mosaics
of variously coloured tiles, to Canton, one of the great commercial
centres of the Flowery Land.&nbsp; As she approached she surveyed with
wonder the animated scene before her.&nbsp; The river was crowded with
ships and inhabited boats.&nbsp; Junks there were, almost as large as
the old Spanish galleons, with poops impending far over the water, and
covered in with a roof, like a house.&nbsp; Men-of-war <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>there
were, flat, broad, and long, mounted with twenty or thirty guns, and
adorned in the usual Chinese fashion, with two large painted eyes at
the prow, that they may be the better able to find their way.&nbsp;
Mandarins&rsquo; boats she saw, with doors, and sides, and windows gaily
painted, with carved galleries, and tiny silken flags fluttering from
every point.&nbsp; And flower-boats she also saw; their upper galleries
decked with flowers, garlands, and arabesques, as if these were barks
fitted out for the service of Titania and her fairy company.&nbsp; The
interior is divided into one large apartment and a few cabinets, which
are lighted by windows of fantastic design.&nbsp; Mirrors and silk hangings
embellish the walls, while the enchanting scene is completed with an
ample garniture of glass chandeliers and coloured paper lanterns, interspersed
with lovely little baskets of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to attempt a description of Canton, with its
pagodas, houses, shops, and European factories.&nbsp; Let us direct
our attention to the manners, customs, and peculiarities of its inhabitants.&nbsp;
As to dress and appearance, the costume of both sexes, among the lower
orders, consists of full trousers and long upper garments, and is <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>chiefly
remarkable for its &ldquo;excessive filth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baths and ablutions
have no charm for the Chinaman; he scorns to wear a shirt, and he holds
by his trousers until they drop from his body.&nbsp; The men&rsquo;s
upper garments reach a little below the knee, the women&rsquo;s about
half way down the calf.&nbsp; They are made of nankeen, or dark blue,
brown, or black silk.&nbsp; During the cold season both men and women
wear one summer garment over the other, keeping the whole together with
a girdle; in the extreme heat, however, they suffer them to float as
free as &ldquo;Nora Creina&rsquo;s robes&rdquo; in Moore&rsquo;s pretty
ballad.</p>
<p>The men keep their heads shaved, with the exception of a small patch
at the back, where the hair is carefully cultivated and plaited into
a cue.&nbsp; The thicker and longer this cue is, the prouder is its
owner; false hair and black ribbon, therefore, are all deftly worked
into it, with the result of forming an appendage which often reaches
down to the ankles!&nbsp; While at work the owner twists it round his
neck, but on entering a room he lets it down again, as it would be contrary
to all the laws of etiquette and courtesy for a person to make his appearance
with his cue twisted up.&nbsp; The women comb their hair entirely back
from their forehead, <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and
fasten it to the head in the most artistic plaits.&nbsp; The process
occupies a considerable time, but when the hair is once dressed it is
not retouched for a whole week.&nbsp; Both men and women frequently
go about with heads uncovered; but sometimes they wear hats of thin
bamboo, three feet in diameter.&nbsp; These are not only an adequate
protection against sun and rain, but are exceedingly durable.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Chinese live a kind of aquatic life, and make their
home on board a river-boat.&nbsp; The husband goes on shore to his work,
and his wife meantime adds to the income of the family by ferrying persons
from bank to bank, or letting out the boat to pleasure parties&mdash;always
reserving one half of its accommodation for herself and household.&nbsp;
Room is not very abundant, as the whole boat does not exceed twenty-five
feet in length; but everywhere the greatest order and cleanliness are
apparent, each separate plank being enthusiastically scrubbed and washed
every morning.&nbsp; It is worth notice how each inch of space is turned
to the best advantage, room being made even for the <i>lares</i> and
<i>penates</i>.&nbsp; All the washing and cooking are done during the
day; yet the pleasure party is never in the least degree inconvenienced.</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Of
course our traveller was attracted by the diminutiveness of the feet
of the Chinese women, and she had an opportunity of examining one of
these tiny monstrosities <i>in natur&acirc;</i>.&nbsp; Four of the toes
were bent under the sole of the foot, to which they were firmly pressed,
and simultaneously with which they appeared to have grown, if growth
it can be called; the great toe alone remained in its natural state.&nbsp;
The fore part of the foot had been so swathed and compressed by tight
bandages, that, instead of expanding in length and breadth, it had shot
upwards, so as to form a large lump at the instep, where it became,
so to speak, a portion of the leg; the lower part of the foot was scarcely
five inches long, and an inch and a half broad.&nbsp; The feet are always
encased in white linen or silk, with silk bandages over all, and are
then stuffed into pretty little shoes with very high heels.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
my astonishment,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer, &ldquo;these deformed
beings tripped about, as if in defiance of us broad-footed creatures,
with tolerable ease, the only difference in their gait being that they
waddled like geese; they even ran up and down stairs without a stick.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She adds, that the value of a bride is reckoned by the smallness of
her feet.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>It
was characteristic of Madame Pfeiffer that she found means to see much
which no European woman had ever seen before.&nbsp; She obtained access
even to a Buddhist temple,&mdash;that of Houan, reputed to be one of
the finest in China.&nbsp; The sacred enclosure is surrounded by a high
wall.&nbsp; The visitor enters first a large outer court, at the extremity
of which a huge gateway opens upon an inner court.&nbsp; Beneath the
arch stand two statues of war-gods, each eighteen feet high, with terribly
distorted faces and the most menacing attitudes; these are supposed
to prevent the approach of evil genii.&nbsp; A second portal, of similar
construction, under which are placed the &ldquo;four heavenly kings,&rdquo;
leads to a third court, surrounding the principal temple, a structure
one hundred feet in length, and of equal breadth.&nbsp; On rows of wooden
pillars is supported a flat roof, from which glass lamps, lustres, artificial
flowers, and brightly-coloured ribbons hang suspended.&nbsp; All about
the area are scattered statues, altars, vases of flowers, censers, candelabra,
and other accessories.</p>
<p>But the eye is chiefly attracted by the three altars in the foreground,
with the three coloured statues behind them, of Buddha, seated, as emblematic
of Past, Present, and Future.&nbsp; On the occasion <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>of
Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit a service was being performed,&mdash;a
funeral ceremony in honour of a mandarin&rsquo;s deceased wife, and
at his expense.&nbsp; Before the altars on the right and left stood
several priests, in garments strangely resembling, as did the ceremonial
observances, those of the Roman Church.&nbsp; The mandarin himself,
attended by two servants armed with large fans, prayed before the central
altar.&nbsp; He kissed the ground repeatedly, and each time he did so
three sweet-scented wax-tapers were put into his hand.&nbsp; After raising
them in the air, he handed them to the priests, who then stationed them,
unlighted, before the Buddha images.&nbsp; Meantime, the temple resounded
with the blended strains of three musicians, one of whom struck a metal
ball, the other scraped a stringed instrument, and the third educed
shrill notes from a kind of flute.</p>
<p>This principal temple is surrounded by numerous smaller sanctuaries,
each decorated with images of deities, rudely wrought, but glowing with
gilt and vivid colours.&nbsp; Special reverence seems to be accorded
to Kwanfootse, a demigod of War, and the four-and-twenty gods of Mercy.&nbsp;
These latter have four, six, and even eight arms.&nbsp; In the Temple
of Mercy Madame Pfeiffer met with an unpleasant <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>adventure.&nbsp;
A Bonze had offered her and her companions a couple of wax tapers to
light in honour of the god.&nbsp; They were on the point of complying,
as a matter of civility, when an American missionary, who made one of
the party, snatched them roughly from their hands, and gave them back
to the priests, protesting that such compliance was idolatrous.&nbsp;
The Bonze, in high indignation, closed the door, and summoned his brethren,
who hurried in from all sides, and jostled and pushed and pressed, while
using the most violent language.&nbsp; It was not without difficulty
they forced their way through the crowd, and escaped from the temple.</p>
<p>The guide next led the curiosity-hunters to the so-called House of
the Sacred Swine.&nbsp; The greatest attention is paid to these porcine
treasures, and they reside in a spacious stone hall; but not the less
is the atmosphere heavy with odours that are not exactly those of Araby
the Blest.&nbsp; Throughout their sluggish existence the swine are carefully
fed and cherished, and no cruel knife cuts short the thread of their
destiny.&nbsp; At the time of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit only one
pair were enjoying their <i>otium cum dignitate</i>, and the number
rarely exceeds three pairs.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Peeping
into the interior of a Bonze&rsquo;s house, the company came upon an
opium-smoker.&nbsp; He lay stretched upon a mat, with small tea-cups
beside him, some fruit, a tiny lamp, and several miniature-headed pipes,
from one of which he was inhaling the intoxicating smoke.&nbsp; It is
said that some of the Chinese opium-smokers consume as much as twenty
or thirty grains daily.&nbsp; This poor wretch was not wholly unconscious
of the presence of visitors; and, laying by his pipe, he raised himself
from the ground, and dragged his body to a chair.&nbsp; With deadly
pale face and fixed, staring eyes, he presented a miserable appearance.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Our traveller also visited a pagoda,&mdash;the Half-Way Pagoda; so
called by the English because it is situated half-way between Canton
and Whampoa.&nbsp; On a small hillock, in the midst of vast tracts of
rice, it raises its nine stories to a height of one hundred and seventy
feet.&nbsp; Though formerly of great repute, it is now deserted.&nbsp;
The interior has been stripped of statues and ornaments, and the floors
having been removed, the visitor sees to the very summit.&nbsp; Externally,
each stage is indicated by a small balcony without railing, access being
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>obtained
by steep and narrow flights of stairs.&nbsp; A picturesque effect is
produced by these projections, as everybody knows who has examined a
&ldquo;willow-pattern&rdquo; plate.&nbsp; They are built of coloured
bricks, which are laid in rows, with their points jutting obliquely
outwards, and faced with variegated tiles.</p>
<p>Even more interesting was Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s peep into the &ldquo;domestic
interior&rdquo; of Mandarin Howqua.</p>
<p>The house was of large size, but only one story high, with wide and
splendid terraces.&nbsp; The windows looked into the inner courts.&nbsp;
At the entrance were two painted images of gods to ward off evil spirits,
like the horse-shoe formerly suspended to the cottages and barns of
our English peasants.</p>
<p>The front part was divided into several reception rooms, without
front walls; and adjoining these, bloomed bright and gaily-ordered parterres
of flowers and shrubs.&nbsp; The magnificent terraces above also bloomed
with blossom, and commanded a lively view of the crowded river, and
of the fine scenery that spreads around Canton.&nbsp; Elegant little
cabinets surrounded these rooms, being separated by thin partitions,
through which the eye could easily <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>penetrate,
and frequently embellished with gay and skilfully-executed paintings.&nbsp;
The material used was chiefly bamboo, which was as delicate as gauze,
and copiously decorated with painted flowers or beautifully-written
proverbs.</p>
<p>The chairs and sofas were numerous, and of really artistic workmanship.&nbsp;
Some of the arm-chairs were cunningly wrought out of a single piece
of wood.&nbsp; The seats of others were beautiful marble slabs; of others,
again, fine coloured tiles or porcelain.&nbsp; Articles of European
manufacture, such as handsome mirrors, clocks, vases, and tables of
Florentine mosaic or variegated marble, were plentiful.&nbsp; There
was also a remarkable collection of lamps and lanterns pendent from
the ceilings, consisting&mdash;these lamps and lanterns&mdash;of glass,
transparent horn, and coloured gauze or paper, ornamented with glass
beads, fringe, and tassels.&nbsp; And as the walls were also largely
supplied with lamps, the apartments, when lighted up, assumed a truly
fairy-like character.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page77.jpg">
<img alt="Chinese House and Garden" src="images/page77.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The mandarin&rsquo;s pleasure-garden stretched along the river-side.&nbsp;
Its cultivation was perfect, but no taste was shown in its arrangement.&nbsp;
Wherever the visitor turned, kiosks, summer-houses, and <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>bridges
confronted her.&nbsp; Every path and open spot were lined with large
and small flower-pots, in which grew flowers and liliputian fruit-trees
of all kinds.&nbsp; In the art of dwarfing trees, if such distortion
and crippling of Nature deserves to be called an art, the Chinese are
certainly most accomplished experts; but what can we think of the taste,
or want of taste, which prefers pigmies three feet high to the lofty
and far-shadowing trees which embellish our English parks and gardens?&nbsp;
Why should a civilized people put Nature in fetters, and delight in
checking her growth, in limiting her spontaneous energies?</p>
<p>Here are some particulars about the tea-plant:&mdash;In the plantations
around Canton, it is not allowed to grow higher than six feet, and is
consequently cut at intervals.&nbsp; Its leaves are considered good
from the third to the eighth year; and the plant is then cut down, in
order that it may throw off new shoots, or else it is rooted out.&nbsp;
Three gatherings take place in the year; the first in March, the second
in April, and the third, which lasts for three months, in May.&nbsp;
So fine and delicate are the leaves of the first gathering, that they
might easily be mistaken for the blossom; which undoubtedly has <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>originated
the error that the so-called &ldquo;bloom or imperial tea&rdquo; consists
of the flowers and not of the leaves of the plant.</p>
<p>When gathered, the leaves are thrown for a few seconds into boiling
water, and then placed on flat iron plates, inserted slantwise in stone-work.&nbsp;
While roasting over a gentle fire, they are continually stirred.&nbsp;
As soon as they begin to curl a little, they are scattered over large
planks, and each single leaf is rolled together; a process so rapidly
accomplished that it requires a person&rsquo;s sole attention to detect
that only one leaf is rolled up at a time.&nbsp; This completed, all
the leaves are again placed in the pans.&nbsp; Black tea takes some
time to roast; and the green is frequently coloured with Prussian blue,
an exceedingly small quantity of which is added during the second roasting.&nbsp;
Last of all, the tea is once more shaken out upon the boards, and submitted
to a careful inspection, the leaves that are not entirely closed being
rolled over again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page81.jpg">
<img alt="Singapore" src="images/page81.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer had an opportunity of tasting a cup of tea made after
the most approved Chinese fashion.&nbsp; A small quantity was dropped
into a delicate porcelain cup, boiling water was poured upon it, and
a tightly-fitting cover then adjusted to <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the
cup.&nbsp; After a few seconds, the infusion was ready for drinking&mdash;neither
milk, cream, nor sugar being added.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>But we must tarry no longer within the borders of the Celestial Empire.&nbsp;
We have to follow Madame Pfeiffer in her wanderings over many seas and
through many countries,&mdash;for in the course of her adventurous career
she saw more of &ldquo;men and cities&rdquo; than even the much-travelling
Ulysses,&mdash;and our limits confine us to brief notices of the most
remarkable places she visited.</p>
<p>From China she sailed for the East Indies.</p>
<p>On her way she &ldquo;looked in&rdquo; at Singapore, a British settlement,
where gather the traders of many Asiatic nations.&nbsp; The scenery
which stretches around it is of a rich and agreeable character, and
the island on which it is situated excels in fertility of vegetation.&nbsp;
A saunter among the plantations of cloves and nutmegs is very pleasant,
the air breathing a peculiar balsamic fragrance.&nbsp; The nutmeg-tree
is about the size of a good apricot-bush, and from top to bottom is
a mass of foliage; the branches grow very low down the stem, and the
leaves glitter as if they were varnished.&nbsp; The fruit closely <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>resembles
an apricot, covered with spots of yellowish-brown.&nbsp; It bursts on
attaining maturity, and then reveals a round kernel, of the size of
a nut, embedded in a network, sold as mace, of a beautiful red colour.&nbsp;
This network of fibrous material is carefully separated from the nutmeg,
and dried in the shade,&mdash;being frequently sprinkled with sea-water,
to prevent the colour deepening into black, instead of changing into
yellow.&nbsp; The nutmeg is likewise dried, exposed a while to the action
of smoke, and dipped several times into sea-water containing a weak
solution of lime, to prevent it from turning mouldy.</p>
<p>The clove-tree is smaller, and less copiously provided with foliage,
than the nutmeg-tree.&nbsp; The buds form what are known to us as cloves;
and, of course, are gathered before they have had time to blossom.&nbsp;
The areca-nut palm is also plentiful in Singapore.&nbsp; It grows in
clusters of from ten to twenty nuts; is somewhat larger than a nutmeg,
and of a bright colour, almost resembling gilt.</p>
<p>The Chinese and the natives of the Eastern Islands chew it with betel-leaf
and calcined mussel-shells.&nbsp; With a small quantity of the latter
they strew the leaf; a very small piece of the nut is <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>added,
and the whole is made into a little packet, which they put into their
mouth.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer also inspected a sago manufactory.&nbsp; The unprepared
farina, which is the pith of the sago palm, is imported from a neighbouring
island.&nbsp; The tree is cut down when it is seven years old, split
from top to bottom, and the pith extracted from it.&nbsp; Then it is
freed from the fibres, pressed in large frames, and dried at the fire
or in the sun.&nbsp; At Singapore this pith or meal, which is of a yellowish
tint, is steeped in water for several days until completely blanched;
it is then once more dried by the fire or in the sun, passed under a
large wooden roller, and through a hair sieve.&nbsp; When it has become
white and fine, it is placed in a kind of linen winnowing-fan, which
is kept damp in a peculiar manner.&nbsp; The workman takes a mouthful
of water, and &ldquo;spirts it out like fine rain over the fan;&rdquo;
the meal being alternately shaken and moistened until it assumes the
character of small globules.&nbsp; These are stirred round in large
flat pans, until they are dried.&nbsp; Then they are passed through
a second sieve, not quite so fine as the first, and the larger globules
are separated from the rest.</p>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Pepper
and gambir plantations are also among the &ldquo;sights&rdquo; of Singapore.&nbsp;
The pepper-tree is a small bush-like plant, which, when carefully trained,
springs to a height of eighteen feet.&nbsp; The pepper-pods grow in
small clusters, and change from red to green, and then to black.&nbsp;
White pepper is nothing more than the black pepper blanched by frequent
steeping in sea-water.&nbsp; The gambir does not grow taller than eight
feet.&nbsp; The leaves, which are used in dyeing, are first stripped
from the stalk, and then boiled down in large coppers.&nbsp; The thick
juice is placed in white wooden vessels, and dried in the sun; then
it is divided into slips about three inches long, and packed up.</p>
<p>Singapore is an island of <i>fruits</i>.&nbsp; It boasts of the delicious
mangosteen, which almost melts in the mouth, and delights the palate
with its exquisite flavour.&nbsp; It boasts, too, of splendid pine-apples,
frequently weighing as much as four pounds.&nbsp; Also of sauersop,
as big as the biggest pine-apples, green outside, and white or pale
yellow inside, with a taste and fragrance like that of strawberries.&nbsp;
Nor must the gumaloh be forgotten: it is divided, like the orange, into
sections, but is five times as large, and not quite so sweet.&nbsp;
Finally, we must refer to the <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>custard-apple,
which is very white (though full of black pips), very soft, and very
enticing in flavour.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From Singapore we follow Madame Pfeiffer to Point de Galle, in Ceylon.&nbsp;
The appearance of this fair and fertile island from the sea is the theme
of every traveller&rsquo;s praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was one of the most
magnificent sights I ever beheld,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer, &ldquo;to
see the island soaring gradually from the sea, with its mountain-ranges
growing more and more distinctly defined, their summits lighted by the
sun, while the dense cocoa-groves, and hills and plains, lay shrouded
in shadow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Above the whole towers the purple mass of Adam&rsquo;s
Peak; and the eye rests in every direction on the most luxuriant foliage,
with verdurous glades, and slopes carpeted with flowers.</p>
<p>Point de Galle presents a curious mixture of races.&nbsp; Cingalese,
Kanditons, Tamils from South India, and Moormen, with crimson caftans
and shaven crowns, form the bulk of the crowds that throng its streets;
but, besides these, there are Portuguese, Chinese, Jews, Arabs, Parsees,
Englishmen, Malays, Dutchmen, and half-caste burghers, and now and then
a veiled Arabian woman, or a Veddah, one of the <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>aboriginal
inhabitants of the island.&nbsp; Sir Charles Dilke speaks of &ldquo;silent
crowds of tall and graceful girls, wearing, as we at first supposed,
white petticoats and bodices; their hair carried off the face with a
decorated hoop, and caught at the back by a high tortoise-shell comb.&nbsp;
As they drew near, moustaches began to show, and I saw that they were
men; whilst walking with them were women naked to the waist, combless,
and far more rough and &lsquo;manly&rsquo; than their husbands.&nbsp;
Petticoat and chignon are male institutions in Ceylon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer, with unresting energy, visited Colombo and Kandy,
the chief towns of the island.&nbsp; At the latter she obtained admission
to the Temple of Dagoba, which contains a precious relic of the god
Buddha&mdash;namely, one of his teeth.&nbsp; The sanctuary containing
this sacred treasure is a small chamber or cell, less than twenty feet
in breadth.&nbsp; It is enveloped in darkness, as there are no windows;
and the door is curtained inside, for the more effectual exclusion of
the light.&nbsp; Rich tapestry covers the walls and ceiling.&nbsp; But
the chief object is the altar, which glitters with plates of silver,
and is incrusted about the edges with precious stones.&nbsp; Upon it
<!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>stands
a bell-shaped case about three feet in height, and three feet in diameter
at the base.&nbsp; It is made of silver, elaborately gilt, and decorated
with a number of costly jewels.&nbsp; A peacock in the middle blazes
with jewels.&nbsp; Six smaller cases, reputed to be of gold, are enclosed
within the large one, and under the last is the tooth of Buddha.&nbsp;
As it is as large as that of a great bull, one trembles to think how
monstrous must have been the jaw of the Indian creed-founder!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page89.jpg">
<img alt="Native boat, Madras" src="images/page89.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Madame Ida Pfeiffer arrived at Madras on the 30th of October.&nbsp;
She describes the process of disembarkation; but as her details are
few, and refer to a comparatively distant date, we propose to rely on
the narrative of a recent traveller.</p>
<p>From time immemorial, he says, the system of landing and embarking
passengers and cargo has been by means of native Massulah boats, constructed
of mango wood, calked with straw, and sewn together with cocoa-nut fibre.&nbsp;
The ships drop their anchors in the roads half a mile from the shore;
the Massulah boat pulls off alongside, receives its cargo at the gangway,
and is then beached through the surf.&nbsp; It is no uncommon circumstance
for the boat <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>alongside,
assisted by the rolling of the ship, to rise and fall twenty-five feet
relatively to the height of the ship&rsquo;s deck at each undulation.&nbsp;
Ladies are lashed into chairs, and from the ship&rsquo;s yard-arm lowered
into the boat.&nbsp; In 1860 some improvement was effected by the construction
of an iron pier, about nine hundred feet in length, and twenty feet
in height.&nbsp; But a spacious and sheltered harbour is now being provided,
by means of piers running out from the shore five hundred yards north
and south respectively of the screw pile pier now existing, so as to
enclose a rectangular area of one thousand yards in length by eight
hundred and thirty yards in width, or one hundred and seventy acres.&nbsp;
The foundation-stone was laid by the Prince of Wales in the course of
his Indian progress in 1876.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer stayed but a few hours at Madras, and her notes respecting
it are of no value.&nbsp; We will proceed at once to Calcutta, the &ldquo;City
of Palaces,&rdquo; as it has been called, and the capital of our Indian
Empire.</p>
<p>She speaks of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Palace as a magnificent building,
and one that would ornament any city in the world.&nbsp; Other noticeable
edifices are the Town Hall, the Hospital, the Museum, Ochterlony&rsquo;s
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Monument,
the Mint, and the Cathedral.&nbsp; Ochterlony&rsquo;s Monument is a
plain stone column, one hundred and sixty-five feet high, erected in
commemoration of a sagacious statesman and an able soldier.&nbsp; From
its summit, to which access is obtained by two hundred and twenty-two
steps, may be obtained a noble view of the city, the broad reaches of
the Ganges, and the fertile plains of Bengal.</p>
<p>The Cathedral is an imposing pile.&nbsp; Its architecture is Gothic,
and the interior produces a very fine effect by the harmony of its proportions
and the richness of its details.&nbsp; The ill-famed &ldquo;Black Hole,&rdquo;
in which the Rajah Surajah Dowlah confined one hundred and fifty English
men and women, when he obtained possession of Calcutta in 1756&mdash;confining
them in a narrow and noisome cell, which poisoned them with its malarious
atmosphere, so that by morning only a few remained alive&mdash;is now
part of a warehouse.&nbsp; But an obelisk stands at the entrance, inscribed
with the names of the victims.</p>
<p>The fashionable promenade at Calcutta is the Maidan.&nbsp; It runs
along the bank of the Hooghly, and is bounded on the other side by rows
of palatial mansions.&nbsp; It commands a good view of the Viceroy&rsquo;s
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Palace,
the Cathedral, the Ochterlony Column, the strong defensive works of
Fort William; and is altogether a very interesting and attractive spot.</p>
<p>Every evening, before sunset, thither wends the fashionable world
of Calcutta.&nbsp; The impassive European, with all the proud consciousness
of a conquering race; the half-Europeanized baboo; the deposed rajah,&mdash;all
may be seen driving to and fro in splendid equipages, drawn by handsome
steeds, and followed by servants in gay Oriental attire.&nbsp; The rajahs
and &ldquo;nabobs&rdquo; are usually dressed in gold-embroidered robes
of silk, over which are thrown the costliest Indian shawls.&nbsp; Ladies
and gentlemen, on English horses of the best blood, canter along the
road, or its turfen borders; while crowds of dusky natives gather in
all directions, or leisurely move homewards after their day&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; A bright feature of the scene is the animated appearance
of the Hooghly: first-class East Indiamen are lying at anchor, ships
are arriving or preparing for departure, the native craft incessantly
ply to and fro, and a Babel of voices of different nationalities rises
on the air.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of the Maidan, drawn by another lady-traveller,
Mrs. Murray Mitchell:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page95.jpg">
<img alt="The Maidan, Calcutta" src="images/page95.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>It
is, she says, a noble expanse, which, about a hundred years ago, was
a wild swampy jungle, famous only for snipe-shooting.&nbsp; Strange
to say, it is not, like most Indian plains, burned up and brown, but,
from its vicinity to the river, and the frequent showers that visit
it, as fresh and green as an English park.&nbsp; It has a few fine tanks,
and is sprinkled with some leafy trees; these, however, not so numerous
as they were before the cyclones of 1864 and 1867, which swept away
its chief natural beauties.&nbsp; Several broad well-kept drives intersect
it, and it is ornamented by some graceful gardens and a few handsome
columns and statues.&nbsp; Indeed, the Maidan is the centre of all that
is grand and imposing; the shabby and the unsightly is kept behind,
out of view.&nbsp; Facing it, along its eastern marge, stand the noble
pillared palaces of Chowringhee.&nbsp; At one end stands the handsome
new Court House; also the Town Hall, and other buildings of less pretence;
and, further on, the noble pile of Government House, with four handsome
entrance gates, and surrounded by shrubberies and gardens.&nbsp; In
front spread the Eden Gardens, a delightful addition to the beauties
both of Government House and the Esplanade.&nbsp; From this point <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the
business part of Calcutta extends in a northerly direction, including
Dalhousie Square, with its many buildings, among which conspicuous stands
the domed Post Office&mdash;the vista closing gracefully with the shapely
spire of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; At the further extremity,
nearly two miles across the verdant expanse, are seen the Cathedral,
with its noble spire, the General Hospital, and the Jail; and still
further, the richly-wooded suburbs of Kidderpore and Alipore.&nbsp;
Fort William fronts toward the river, and with its ramparts and buildings
forms a striking object; while the whole is bordered and &ldquo;beautified&rdquo;
by the broad river, with its crowd of masts and flags, its almost innumerable
boats, its landing-ghats, and all its life and motion.</p>

<p>From Calcutta, Madame Pfeiffer proceeded to the city of temples,
the sacred city of Hinduism&mdash;Benares.&nbsp; She visited several
temples, but found them all agreeing in their leading details.&nbsp;
That of Vishnu has two towers connected by colonnades, the summits of
which are covered with gold plates.&nbsp; Inside are several images
of Vishnu and Siva, wreathed with flowers, and strewn over with grains
of rice and wheat.&nbsp; Images in metal or stone of the sacred <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>bull
are plentiful everywhere; and living bulls wander about freely, the
object of special care and adoration.&nbsp; They are free to stray where
they will, not in the temple precincts only, but also in the streets.</p>
<p>Among the other buildings, the one most worthy of notice is the Mosque
of Aurengzebe, famous on account of its two minarets, which are 150
feet in height, and reported to be the slenderest in the world.&nbsp;
They resemble a couple of needles, and certainly better deserve the
name than that of Cleopatra at Alexandria.&nbsp; Narrow winding staircases
in the interior lead to the summit, on which a small platform, with
a balustrade about a foot high, is erected.&nbsp; From this vantage-point
a noble view of the city, it is said, may be obtained; but few persons,
we should think, have heads cool enough to enjoy it.&nbsp; With all
Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s adventurousness, she did not essay this perilous
experiment.</p>
<p>The Observatory, constructed for the great Mohammedan emperor Akbar,
is also an object of interest.&nbsp; It is not furnished, like a European
observatory, with the usual astronomical instruments, telescopes, rain-gauges,
anemometers, and the like, the <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>handiwork
of cunning artificers in glass and metal; but everything is of stone&mdash;solid,
durable stone.&nbsp; On a raised terrace stand circular tables, semicircular
and quadratic curves, all of stone, and all inscribed with mystic signs
and characters.</p>
<p>Benares is celebrated for its bazaars, in which are exhibited some
of the rarest productions of the East; but its principal attraction
is its sanctity, and crowds of pilgrims resort to its temples, and cleanse
themselves of their sins by bathing in the fast-flowing Ganges.&nbsp;
To die at Benares is regarded as a passport to heaven; and one of the
most frequent sights is the burning of a corpse on the river-bank, with
ceremonies proportioned to the rank and wealth of the deceased&mdash;the
ashes being afterwards committed to the holy waters.&nbsp; Benares is
also famous for its palaces.&nbsp; Of these the most splendid is that
which the rajah inhabits.&nbsp; It was visited by Madame Pfeiffer, who
appears to have gone everywhere and seen everybody at her own sweet
will and pleasure, and she was even admitted to the rajah&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>A handsomely-decorated boat, she says, awaited her and her fellow-traveller
at the bank of the river.&nbsp; They crossed; a palanquin was ready
to <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>receive
them.&nbsp; Soon they arrived at the stately gateway which forms the
entrance to the palace.&nbsp; The interior proved to be a labyrinth
of irregular courts and small unsymmetrical chambers.&nbsp; In one of
the courts a hall, surrounded by plain columns, served as a reception-room.&nbsp;
This was cumbrously loaded with lamps, glass lustres, and European furniture;
on the walls hung some wretched pictures, framed and glazed.&nbsp; Presently
the rajah made his appearance, accompanied by his brother, and attended
by a long train of courtiers.&nbsp; The two princes were gorgeously
attired; they wore wide trousers, long under and short over garments,
all of satin, covered with gold embroidery.&nbsp; The rajah himself,
aged thirty-five, wore short silken cuffs, glowing with gold, and trimmed
with diamonds; several large brilliants shone on his fingers, and rich
gold embroidery was woven about his shoes.&nbsp; His brother, a youth
of nineteen, wore a white turban, with a costly clasp of diamonds and
pearls.&nbsp; Large pearls hung from his ears; rich massive bracelets
clasped his wrists.</p>
<p>The guests having taken their seats, a large silver basin was brought
in, with elaborately-wrought narghillies, and they were invited to smoke.&nbsp;
This <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>honour
they declined.&nbsp; The rajah then smoked in solitary dignity&mdash;his
pipe being changed as soon as he had taken a few whiffs.</p>
<p>A nautchni, or dance by nautches, was next provided for the visitors&rsquo;
entertainment.&nbsp; There were three musicians and two dancers.&nbsp;
The latter were dressed in gay gold-woven muslin robes, with wide silk
gold-broidered trousers, reaching to the ground, and quite covering
their bare feet.&nbsp; One of the musicians beat a couple of small drums;
the others played on four-stringed instruments not unlike a violin.&nbsp;
They stood close behind the dancers, and their music was wholly innocent
of melody or harmony; but to the rhythm, which was strongly accentuated,
the dancers moved their arms, hands, and fingers in a very animated
manner, and at intervals their feet, so as to ring the numerous tiny
bells that cover them.&nbsp; Their attitudes were not ungraceful.&nbsp;
The performance lasted a quarter of an hour, after which they accompanied
the dance with what was intended for singing, but sounded like shrieking.&nbsp;
Meantime, sweetmeats, fruits, and sherbet were handed round.</p>
<p>As a contrast to this gay scene, Madame Pfeiffer describes the performance
of the wretched fanatics <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>called
fakeers.&nbsp; These men inflict upon themselves the most extraordinary
tortures.&nbsp; Thus: they stick an iron hook through their flesh, and
allow themselves to be suspended by it at a height of twenty or five-and-twenty
feet. <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105">{105}</a>&nbsp;
Or for long hours they stand upon one foot in the burning sunshine,
with their arms rigidly extended in the air.&nbsp; Or they hold heavy
weights in various positions, swing round and round for hours together,
and tear the flesh from their bodies with red-hot pincers.&nbsp; Madame
Pfeiffer saw two of these unfortunate victims of a diseased imagination.&nbsp;
One held a heavy axe over his head, in the attitude of a workman bent
on felling a tree; in this position he stood, rigid as a statue.&nbsp;
The other held the point of his toe to his nose.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In her tour through India our traveller passed through Allahabad,
situated at the junction of the Jumna and the Ganges, and the resort
of many pilgrims; Agra, where she admired, as so many travellers have
admired, the lovely Taj-Mahal, erected by the Sultan Jehan in memory
of his favourite <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>wife,&mdash;and
the Pearl Mosque, with its exquisitely delicate carving; Delhi, the
ancient capital of the Moguls, which figured so conspicuously in the
history of the Sepoy rebellion; the cave-temples of Ajunta and Ellora;
and the great commercial emporium of Bombay.</p>
<p>Quitting the confines of British India, Madame Pfeiffer, ever in
quest of the new and strange, sailed to Bassora, and ascended the historic
Tigris, so named from the swiftness of its course, to Bagdad, that quaint,
remote Oriental city, which is associated with so many wonderful legends
and not less wonderful &ldquo;travellers&rsquo; tales.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was of old the residence of the great caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid,
a ruler of no ordinary sagacity, and the hero of many a tradition, whom
&ldquo;The Thousand and One Nights&rdquo; have made familiar to every
English boy.&nbsp; It is still a populous and wealthy city; many of
its houses are surrounded by blooming gardens; its shops are gay with
the products of the Eastern loom; and it descends in terraces to the
bank of the river, which flows in the shade of orchards and groves of
palm.&nbsp; Over all extends the arch of a glowing sky.</p>
<p>From Bagdad an excursion to the ruins of Babylon is natural enough.&nbsp;
They consist of massive <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>fragments
of walls and columns, strewn on either side of the Euphrates.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the 17th of June our heroic traveller joined a caravan which was
bound for Mosul, a distance of three hundred miles, occupying from twelve
to fourteen days.&nbsp; The journey is one of much difficulty and no
little danger, across a desert country of the most lifeless character.&nbsp;
We shall relate a few of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>One day she repaired to a small village in search of food.&nbsp;
After wandering from hut to hut, she obtained a small quantity of milk
and three eggs.&nbsp; She laid the eggs in hot ashes, and covered them
over; filled her leathern flask from the Tigris; and, thus loaded, returned
to the encampment formed by the caravan.&nbsp; She ate her eggs and
drank her milk with an appetite for which an epicure would be thankful.</p>
<p>The mode of making butter in vogue at this village was very peculiar.&nbsp;
The cream was put into a leathern bottle, and shaken about on the ground
until the butter consolidated.&nbsp; It was then put into another bottle
filled with water, and finally turned out as white as snow.</p>
<p>Next day, when they rested during the heat, the <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>guide
of the caravan endeavoured to procure her a little shelter from the
glare of the pitiless sun by laying a small cover over a couple of poles
stuck into the ground.&nbsp; But the place shaded was so small, and
the tent so frail, that she was compelled to sit quietly in one position,
as the slightest movement would have involved it in ruin.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards, when she wished for some refreshment, nothing could be procured
but lukewarm water, bread so hard that it could not be eaten until thoroughly
soaked, and a cucumber without salt or vinegar.</p>
<p>At a village near Kerka the caravan tarried for two days.&nbsp; On
the first day Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s patience was sorely tried.&nbsp;
All the women of the place flocked to examine the stranger.&nbsp; First
they inspected her clothes, then wanted to take the turban off her head;
and, in fact, proved themselves most troublesome intruders.&nbsp; At
last Madame Pfeiffer seized one of them by the arm, and turned her out
of her tent so quickly that she had no time to think of resistance.&nbsp;
By the eloquence of gesture our traveller made the others understand
that, unless they withdrew at once, a similarly abrupt dismissal awaited
them.&nbsp; She then drew a circle round her <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>tent,
and forbade them to cross it; an injunction which was strictly respected.</p>
<p>She had now only to settle with the wife of her guide, who had besieged
her the whole day, pressing as near as possible, and petitioning for
some of her &ldquo;things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fortunately her husband came
on the scene, and to him Madame Pfeiffer preferred her complaint, threatening
to leave his house and seek shelter elsewhere,&mdash;well knowing that
the Arabs consider this a great disgrace.&nbsp; He immediately ordered
his wife to desist, and the traveller was at peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always
succeeded,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer, &ldquo;in obtaining my own will.&nbsp;
I found that energy and boldness influence all people, whether Arabs,
Persians, Bedaween, or others.&rdquo;&nbsp; But for this strong will,
this indomitable resolution, Madame Pfeiffer assuredly could not have
succeeded in the enterprises she so daringly undertook.&nbsp; Even for
a man to have accomplished them would have earned our praise; what shall
we not say when they were conceived and carried out by a woman?</p>
<p>Towards evening, she says, to her great delight a caldron of mutton
was set on the fire.&nbsp; For eight days she had eaten nothing but
bread, cucumbers, and some dates; and therefore had a great <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>desire
for a hot and more nutritious meal.&nbsp; But her appetite was greatly
diminished when she saw their style of cookery.&nbsp; The old woman
(her guide&rsquo;s mother) threw several handfuls of small grain, and
a large quantity of onions, into a panful of water to soften.&nbsp;
In about half an hour she thrust her dirty hands into the water, and
mixed the whole together, now and then taking a mouthful, and after
chewing it, spitting it back again into the pan.&nbsp; Then she took
a dirty rag, strained through it the delicate mixture, and poured it
over the meat in the larger vessel.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer had firmly
resolved not to touch the dish, but when it was ready her longing for
food was so great, and so savoury was the smell, that she reflected
that what she had already eaten was probably not a whit cleaner; in
short, for once she proved false to her resolution.&nbsp; Eating, she
was filled; and the viands gave her increased strength.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On the 28th of June the caravan reached Erbil, the ancient Arbela,
where Alexander the Great defeated Darius and his Persian host.&nbsp;
Next day they crossed a broad river, on rafts of inflated skins, fastened
together with poles, and covered with reeds, canes, and plank.&nbsp;
Rapidly traversing the shrubless, <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>herbless
plains of Mesopotamia, they reached at length the town of Mosul, the
point from which travellers proceed to visit the ruins of Nineveh.</p>
<p>These have been so carefully explored and ably described by Layard
and the late George Smith, that it is needless to quote Madame Ida Pfeiffer&rsquo;s
superficial observations at any length.&nbsp; According to Strabo, Nineveh
was the greatest city in the Old World&mdash;larger even than Babylon;
the circumference of its walls was a three days&rsquo; journey, and
those walls were defended by fifteen hundred towers.&nbsp; Now all is
covered with earth, and the ranges of hills and mounds that stretch
across the wide gray plain on the bank of the Tigris do but cover the
ruins of the vast Assyrian capital.&nbsp; Mr. Layard began his excavations
in 1846, and his labourers, digging deep into the hills, soon opened
up spacious and stately apartments, the marble walls of which were embellished
from top to bottom with sculptures, revealing a complete panorama of
Assyrian life!&nbsp; Kings with their crowns and sceptres, gods swooping
on broad pinions, warriors equipped with their arms and shields, were
there; also stirring representations of battles and hunting expeditions,
of the storming of fortresses, of triumphal processions; though, <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>unfortunately
for artistic effect, neither proportion, perspective, nor correct drawing
had been observed.&nbsp; The hills are scarcely three times higher than
the men; the fields reach to the clouds; the trees are no taller than
the lotus-flowers; and the heads of men and animals are all alike, and
all in profile.&nbsp; Intermingled with these scenes of ancient civilization
are inscriptions of great interest, in the cuneiform or wedge-shaped
character.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>A caravan starting from Mosul for Tabreez, Madame Ida Pfeiffer determined
on joining it, though warned that it would traverse a country containing
not a single European.&nbsp; But, as we have already had abundant evidence,
Madame Pfeiffer knew not what fear was.&nbsp; Nothing could daunt her
fixed purpose.&nbsp; She had made up her mind to go to Persia; and to
Persia she would go.&nbsp; She started with the caravan on the 8th of
July, and next day crossed the hills that intervene between Mesopotamia
and Kurdistan.&nbsp; The latter country has never enjoyed a good reputation
among travellers; and Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s experience was not calculated
to retrieve its character.&nbsp; The caravan was crossing a corn-field
which had been recently reaped, when half-a-dozen stalwart <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Kurds,
armed with stout cudgels, sprang out from their hiding-place among the
sheaves, and seizing the travellers&rsquo; bridles, poured out upon
them what was unmistakably a volley of oaths and threats.&nbsp; One
of the travellers leaped from his steed, seized his assailant by the
throat, and holding a loaded pistol to his head, indicated his determination
of blowing out his brains.&nbsp; The effect of this resolute conduct
was immediate; the robbers desisted from their attack, and were soon
engaged in quite an amicable conversation with those they had intended
to plunder.&nbsp; At last they pointed out a good place for an encampment,
receiving in return a trifling <i>backshish</i>, collected from the
whole caravan.</p>
<p>A few days later, the travellers, having started at two in the morning,
entered a magnificent mountain-valley, which had been cloven through
the solid rock by the waters of a copious stream.&nbsp; A narrow stony
path followed the course of the stream upward.&nbsp; The moon shone
in unclouded light; or it would have been difficult even for the well-trained
horses of the caravan to have kept their footing along the dangerous
way, encumbered as it was with fallen masses of rock.</p>
<p>Like chamois, however, they scrambled up the <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>steep
mountain-side, and safely carried their riders round frightful projections
and past dangerous, dizzy precipices.&nbsp; So wild, so romantic was
the scene, with its shifting lights and shadows, its sudden bursts of
silvery lustre where the valley lay open to the moon, and its depths
of darkness in many a winding recess, that even Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s
uncultured companions were irresistibly moved by its influence; and
as they rode along not a sound was heard but the clatter of the horses&rsquo;
hoofs, and the fall of rolling stones into the chasm below.&nbsp; But
all at once thick clouds gathered over the moon, and the gloom became
so intense that the travellers could scarcely discern each one his fellow.&nbsp;
The leader continually struck fire with a flint, that the sparks might
afford some slight indication of the proper course.&nbsp; But this was
not enough; and as the horses began to miss their footing, the only
hope of safety consisted in remaining immovable.&nbsp; With the break
of day, however, a gray light spread over the scene, and the travellers
found themselves surrounded by a circle of lofty mountains, rising one
above the other in magnificent gradation, and superbly dominated by
one mighty snow-crowned mass.</p>
<p>The journey was resumed.&nbsp; Soon the travellers <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>became
aware of the fact that the path was sprinkled with spots of blood.&nbsp;
At last they came to a place which was crimsoned by a complete pool;
and looking down into the ravine, they could see two human bodies, one
lying scarcely a hundred feet below them, the other, which had rolled
further, half hidden by a projecting crag.&nbsp; From this scene of
murder they gladly hastened.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At a town called Ravandus Madame Pfeiffer rested for some days, making
observations on the manners and customs of the Kurds.&nbsp; She was
not prepossessed in their favour by what she saw: the women are idle,
ignorant, and squalid; the men work as little and rob as much as they
can.&nbsp; Polygamy is practised; and religion is reduced to the performance
of a few formalities.&nbsp; The costume of the wealthier Kurds is purely
Oriental, that of the common people varies from it a little.&nbsp; The
men wear wide linen trousers, and over them a shirt confined by a girdle,
with a sleeveless woollen jacket, made of stuff of only a hand&rsquo;s-breadth
wide, and sewed together.&nbsp; Instead of white trousers, some wear
brown, which are anything but picturesque, and look like sacks with
two holes for the insertion <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>of
the feet,&mdash;the said feet being encased in boots of red or yellow
leather, with large iron heels; or in shoes of coarse white wool, adorned
with three tassels.&nbsp; The turban is the universal head-covering.</p>
<p>The women don loose trousers, and red or yellow boots, with iron
heels, like the men; but over all they wear a long blue garment which,
if not tucked up under the girdle, would depend some inches below the
ankles.&nbsp; A large blue shawl descends below the knee.&nbsp; Round
their heads they twist black shawls, turban-wise; or they wear the red
fez, with a silk handkerchief wound about it; and on the top of this,
a kind of wreath made of short black fringe, worn like a diadem, but
leaving the forehead free.&nbsp; The hair falls in narrow braids over
the shoulders, and from the turban droops a heavy silver chain.&nbsp;
As a head-dress it is remarkably attractive; and it is but just to say
that it often sets off really handsome faces, with fine features, and
glowing eyes.</p>

<p>In her further wanderings through the wild lands of Persia, our traveller
came to Urumiyeh, on the borders of the salt lake of that name, which
in several physical features closely resembles the Dead Sea.&nbsp; Urumiyeh
is a place of some celebrity, for it <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>gave
birth to Zoroaster, the preacher of a creed of considerable moral purity,
which has spread over a great part of Asia.&nbsp; Entering a more fertile
country, she reached Tabreez in safety, and was once more within the
influence of law and order.&nbsp; Tabreez, the residence of the viceroy,
is a handsomely-built town, with numerous silk and leather manufactories,
and is reputed to be one of the chief seats of Asiatic commerce.&nbsp;
Its streets are clean and tolerably broad; in each a little rivulet
is carried underground, with openings at regular intervals for the purpose
of dipping out water.&nbsp; Of the houses the passer-by sees no more
than is seen in any other Oriental town: lofty walls, windowless, with
low entrances; and the fronts always looking in upon the open courtyards,
which bloom with trees and flowers, and usually adjoin a pleasant garden.&nbsp;
Inside, the chambers are usually lofty and spacious, with rows of windows
which seem to form complete walls of glass.&nbsp; Buildings of public
importance there are none; excepting the bazaar, which covers a considerable
area, and is laid out with lofty, broad, and covered thoroughfares.</p>
<p>The traveller turned her back upon Tabreez on the 11th of August,
and in a carriage drawn by <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>post-horses,
and attended by a single servant, set out for Natschivan.&nbsp; At Arax
she crossed the frontier of Asiatic Russia, the dominions of the &ldquo;White
Tsar,&rdquo; who, in Asia as in Europe, is ever pressing more and more
closely on the &ldquo;unspeakable Turk.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Natschivan she
joined a caravan which was bound for Tiflis, and the drivers of which
were Tartars.&nbsp; She says of the latter, that they do not live so
frugally as the Arabs.&nbsp; Every evening a savoury pillau was made
with good-tasting fat, frequently with dried grapes or plums.&nbsp;
They also partook largely of fruits.</p>
<p>The caravan wound through the fair and fertile valleys which lie
at the base of Ararat.&nbsp; Of that famous and majestic mountain, which
lifts its white glittering crest of snow some sixteen thousand feet
above the sea-level, our traveller obtained a fine view.&nbsp; Its summit
is cloven into two peaks, and in the space between an old tradition
affirms that Noah&rsquo;s ark landed at the subsidence of the Great
Flood.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of a town called Sidin, Madame Pfeiffer met
with a singular adventure.&nbsp; She was returning from a short walk,
when, hearing the sound of approaching post-horses, she paused for a
minute to see the travellers, and noticed a <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Russian,
seated in an open car, with a Cossack holding a musket by his side.&nbsp;
As soon as the vehicle had passed, she resumed her course; when, to
her astonishment, it suddenly stopped, and almost at the same moment
she felt a fierce grasp on her arms.&nbsp; It was the Cossack, who endeavoured
to drag her to the car.&nbsp; She struggled with him, and pointing to
the caravan, said she belonged to it; but the fellow put his hand on
her mouth, and flung her into the car, where she was firmly seized by
the Russian.&nbsp; Then the Cossack sprang to his seat, and away they
went at a smart gallop.&nbsp; The whole affair was the work of a few
seconds, so that Madame Pfeiffer could scarcely recognize what had happened.&nbsp;
As the man still held her tightly, and kept her mouth covered up, she
was unable to give an alarm.&nbsp; The brave woman, however, retained
her composure, and speedily arrived at the conclusion that her &ldquo;heroic&rdquo;
captors had mistaken her for some dangerous spy.&nbsp; Uncovering her
mouth, they began to question her closely; and Madame Pfeiffer understood
enough Russian to tell them her name, native country, and object in
travelling.&nbsp; This did not satisfy them, and they asked for her
passport,&mdash;which, however, she could not show them, as it was in
her portmanteau.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>At
length they reached the post-house.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer was shown
into a room, at the door of which the Cossack stationed himself with
his musket.&nbsp; She was detained all night; but the next morning,
having fetched her portmanteau, they examined her passport, and were
then pleased to dismiss her&mdash;without, however, offering any apology
for their shameful treatment of her.&nbsp; Such are the incivilities
to which travellers in the Russian dominions are too constantly exposed.&nbsp;
It is surprising that a powerful government should condescend to so
much petty fear and mean suspicion.</p>

<p>From Tiflis our traveller proceeded across Georgia to Redutkali;
whence she made her way to Kertsch, on the shore of the Sea of Azov;
and thence to Sebastopol, destined a few years later to become the scene
of an historic struggle.&nbsp; She afterwards reached Odessa, one of
the great granaries of Europe, situated at the mouth of the Dniester
and the Dnieper.&nbsp; From Odessa to Constantinople the distance by
sea is four hundred and twenty miles.&nbsp; She made but a short stay
in the Turkish capital; and then proceeded by steamer to Smyrna, passing
through the maze of the beautiful isles of Greece; and from Smyrna to
Athens.&nbsp; Here she trod on hallowed <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>ground.&nbsp;
Every temple, every ruin, recalled to her some brave deed of old, or
some illustrious name of philosopher, warrior, statesman, poet, that
the world will not willingly let die.&nbsp; A rush of stirring glorious
memories swept over her mind as she gazed on the lofty summit of the
Acropolis, covered with memorials of the ancient art, and associated
with the great events of Athenian history.&nbsp; The Parthenon, or Temple
of Pallas; the Temple of Theseus; that of Olympian Jove; the Tower of
the Winds, or so-called Lantern of Demosthenes; and the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates,&mdash;all these she saw, and wondered at.&nbsp; But they
have been so frequently described, that we may pass them here with this
slight reference.</p>
<p>From Corinth our traveller crossed to Corfu, and from Corfu ascended
the Adriatic to Trieste.&nbsp; A day or two afterwards she was received
by her friends at Vienna,&mdash;having accomplished the most extraordinary
journey ever undertaken by a woman, and made the complete circuit of
the world.&nbsp; In the most remarkable scenes, and in the most critical
positions, she had preserved a composure, a calmness of courage, and
a simplicity of conduct, that must always command our admiration.</p>
<h2><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>CHAPTER
III.&mdash;NORTHWARD.</h2>
<p>In giving to the world a narrative of her journey to Iceland, and
her wanderings through Norway and Sweden, Madame Pfeiffer anticipated
certain objections that would be advanced by the over-refined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Another journey!&rdquo; she supposed them to exclaim; &ldquo;and
that to regions far more likely to repel than attract the general traveller!&nbsp;
What object could this woman have had in visiting them, but a desire
to excite our astonishment and raise our curiosity?&nbsp; We might have
been induced to pardon her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, though it was
sufficiently hazardous for a solitary woman, because it was prompted,
perhaps, by her religious feelings,&mdash;and incredible things, as
we all know, are frequently accomplished under such an impulse.&nbsp;
But, for the <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>present
expedition, what reasonable motive can possibly be suggested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer remarks that in all this a great injustice is, or
would be, done to her; that she was a plain, inoffensive creature, and
by no means desirous of drawing upon herself the observation of the
crowd.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, she was but following the bent of
her natural disposition.&nbsp; From her earliest childhood she had yearned
to go forth into the wide world.&nbsp; She could never meet a travelling-carriage
without stopping to watch it, and envying the postilion who drove it
or the persons it conveyed.&nbsp; When she was ten or twelve years old,
no reading had such a charm for her as books of voyages and travels;
and then she began to repine at the happiness of every great navigator
or discoverer, whose boldness revealed to him the secrets of lands and
seas before unknown.</p>
<p>She travelled much with her parents, and afterwards with her husband,
and thus her natural bias was encouraged.&nbsp; It was not until her
two sons were of age to be educated that she remained stationary&mdash;on
their account.&nbsp; As the business concerns of her husband required
his presence alternately in Vienna and in Lemberg, he intrusted to his
wife the <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>responsible
duty of superintending their education&mdash;feeling assured that, with
her perseverance and affection, she could supply the place of both parents.</p>
<p>When this duty was discharged, and the education of her sons completed,
the dreams and fancies of her youth once more revived within her.&nbsp;
She thought of the manners and customs of foreign lands, of remote islands
girdled by the &ldquo;melancholy main,&rdquo; and dwelt so long on the
great joy of treading &ldquo;the blessed acres&rdquo; trodden by the
Saviour&rsquo;s feet, that at last she resolved on a pilgrimage thither.&nbsp;
She made the journey to Palestine.&nbsp; She visited Jerusalem, and
other hallowed scenes, and she returned in safety.&nbsp; She came, therefore,
to the conclusion that she was not presumptuously tempting the providence
of God, or laying herself open to the charge of wishing to excite the
admiration of her contemporaries, if she followed her inward impulse,
and once more adventured forth to see the world.&nbsp; She knew that
travel could not but broaden her views, elevate her thoughts, and inspire
her with new sympathies.&nbsp; Iceland, the next object of her desires,
was a country where she hoped to see Nature under an entirely novel
and peculiar aspect.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;so
wonderfully happy, and draw so close to my Maker, <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>while
gazing upon such scenes, that no difficulties or fatigues can deter
me from seeking so great a reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It was in the year 1845 that Madame Pfeiffer began her northward
journey.&nbsp; She left Vienna on the 10th of April, and by way of Prague,
Dresden, and Altona, proceeded to Kiel.&nbsp; Thence the steamer carried
her to Copenhagen, a city of which she speaks in favourable terms.&nbsp;
She notices its numerous splendid palaces; its large and regular squares;
its broad and handsome promenades.&nbsp; At the Museum of Art she was
interested by the chair which Tycho Brahe, the astronomer, formerly
used; and at the Thorvaldsen Museum, the colossal lion executed by the
great Danish sculptor.&nbsp; Having seen all that was to be seen, she
took ship for Iceland, passing Helsingborg on the Swedish coast, and
Elsinore on the Danish, the latter associated with Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hamlet;&rdquo; and, through the Sound and the Cattegat, entering
upon the restless waters of the North Sea.&nbsp; Iceland came in sight
on the seventh day of a boisterous voyage, which had tried our traveller
somewhat severely; and at the close of the eleventh day she reached
Havenfiord, an excellent <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>harbour,
two miles from Reikiavik, the capital of Iceland.</p>
<p>Her first impressions of the Icelandic coast, she says, were very
different from the descriptions she had read in books.&nbsp; She had
conceived of a barren desolate waste, shrubless and treeless; and she
saw grassy hillocks, leafy copses, and even, as she thought, patches
of dwarfish woods.&nbsp; But as she drew nearer, and could distinguish
the different objects more plainly, the hillocks were transformed into
human habitations, with small doors and windows; and the groups of trees
proved to be huge lava masses, from ten to fifteen feet in height, entirely
overgrown with verdure and moss.&nbsp; Everything was new, was surprising;
and it was with pleasurable sensations of excitement and curiosity that
Madame Pfeiffer landed on the shores of Ultima Thule.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page135.jpg">
<img alt="Reikiavik" src="images/page135.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At Reikiavik she found the population inhabiting two very different
classes of habitations.&nbsp; The wooden houses of the well-to-do are
of a single story, she says, with five or six windows in front.&nbsp;
A low flight of steps conducts to an entrance in the centre of the building;
and this entrance opens into a vestibule, where two doors communicate
with the <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>rooms
on the right and left respectively.&nbsp; In the rear is the kitchen,
and beyond the courtyard.&nbsp; Such a house contains four or five rooms
on the ground-floor, and a few small chambers under the roof.&nbsp;
The domestic or household arrangements are entirely European.&nbsp;
The furniture, much of which is mahogany, comes from Copenhagen, which
also supplies the mirrors and cast-iron stoves.&nbsp; Handsome rugs
are spread in front of the sofas; neat curtains drop before the windows;
English engravings ornament the whitewashed walls; and china, silver,
and cut-glass, and the like, are displayed upon the cabinets or corner-tables.</p>
<p>But the poor live in huts which are decidedly much more Icelandic.&nbsp;
They are small and low; built of lava blocks, filled in with earth;
and as the whole is covered with turf, they might almost be mistaken
for natural elevations of the ground, if the wooden chimneys, and low
doors, and almost imperceptible windows, did not betray that they were
tenanted by human beings.&nbsp; A dark, narrow passage, not more than
four feet high, leads on one hand to the living-room, on the other to
the store-room, where the provisions are kept, and where, in winter,
the cows and sheep are stabled.&nbsp; The fireplace is <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>generally
at the end of this passage, which is purposely built low to keep out
the cold.&nbsp; Neither the walls nor floors of these huts are boarded;
the dwelling-rooms are scarcely large enough for people to sleep in
or turn round in; and the whole furniture consists of the bedsteads
(very poorly supplied with bedding), a small table, and a few chests&mdash;the
latter, as well as the beds, being used for seats.&nbsp; To poles fastened
in the walls are suspended clothes, shoes, stockings, and other articles;
and in each hut is generally found a tiny book-shelf supporting a few
volumes.&nbsp; No stoves are needed in these rooms, which are sufficiently
warmed by the presence of their numerous inmates.</p>
<p>Speaking of the better classes of the inhabitants of the Icelandic
capital, our traveller says: &ldquo;Nothing struck me so much as the
great dignity of carriage at which the Icelandic ladies aim, and which
is so apt to degenerate into stiffness when it is not perfectly natural,
or has not become a second nature by habit.&nbsp; They incline their
head very coolly when you meet them, with less civility than we should
use towards an inferior or a stranger.&nbsp; The lady of the house never
accompanies her guests beyond the door of the room, after a call; if
the husband is <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>present,
he goes a little further; but when this is not the case, you are often
at a loss which way to turn, as there is no servant on the spot to open
the street door for you, unless it may happen to be in the house of
the Stiftsamtmann, the first dignitary of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church at Reikiavik is capable of accommodating about one hundred
and fifty persons; it is built of stone, with a wooden roof, under which
is kept a library of several thousand volumes.&nbsp; It possesses an
artistic treasure of no ordinary value in a font by Thorvaldsen, whose
parents were natives of Iceland, though he himself was born in Denmark.&nbsp;
Captain Burton describes it as the ancient classical altar, with basso-relievos
on all four sides&mdash;subjects of course evangelical; on the top an
alto-relievo of symbolical flowers, roses, and passiflor&aelig; is cut
to support the normal &ldquo;Dobefal,&rdquo; or baptismal basin.&nbsp;
In the sacristy are preserved some handsome priestly robes&mdash;especially
the velvet vestment sent by Pope Julius II. to the last Roman Catholic
bishop in the early part of the sixteenth century, and still worn by
the chief Protestant dignitary at ordinations.</p>
<p>The climate at Reikiavik would be considered severe by an Englishman.&nbsp;
The thermometer <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>sometimes
sinks as low as 13&deg; below zero, and the sea is covered with ice
for several feet from the shore.&nbsp; The storms and snow-drifts are
of the most terrible character, and at times even the boldest Icelander
dares not cross his threshold.&nbsp; Daylight does not last more than
four or five hours; but the long night is illuminated by the splendid
coruscations of the aurora, filling the firmament with many-coloured
flame.&nbsp; From the middle until the end of June, however, there is
no night.&nbsp; The sun sinks for a short time below the hills, but
twilight blends with the dawn, and before the last rays of evening have
faded from the sky the morning light streams forth with renewed brilliancy.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Then, as to the people, Madame Pfeiffer speaks of them as of medium
height and strength.&nbsp; Their hair is light, and frequently has a
reddish tint; their eyes are blue.&nbsp; The women are more prepossessing
in appearance than the men; and pleasing faces are not uncommon among
the young girls.&nbsp; They wear long skirts of coarse black woollen
stuff, with spencers, and coloured aprons.&nbsp; They cover their heads
with a man&rsquo;s cap of the same material as their petticoats, ending
in a drooping point, to which <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>hangs
a woollen or silken tassel, falling as low as the shoulders.&nbsp; This
simple head-dress is not inelegant.&nbsp; All the women have an abundance
of hair hanging picturesquely about their face and neck; they wear it
loose and short, and it is sometimes curled.</p>
<p>The men appear to dress very much like the German peasants.&nbsp;
They wear pantaloons, jackets, and vests of dark cloth, with a felt
hat or fur cap, and the feet wrapped in pieces of skin, either seal,
sheep, or calf.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Here, as a corrective, and for the sake of comparison, let us refer
to Captain Burton&rsquo;s description.&nbsp; The men dress, he says,
like sailors, in breeches, jackets serving as coats, and vests of good
broadcloth, with four to six rows of buttons, always metal, either copper
or silver.&nbsp; The fishermen wear overcoats, coarse smooth waistcoats,
large paletots, made waterproof by grease or fish-liver oil; leather
overalls, stockings, and native shoes.&nbsp; The women attire themselves
in jackets and gowns, petticoats and aprons of woollen frieze; over
which is thrown a &ldquo;hempa,&rdquo; or wide black robe, like a Jesuit
frock, trimmed with velvet binding.&nbsp; The wealthy add <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>silver
ornaments down the length of the dress, and braid the other articles
with silk ribbons, galloon, or velvets of various colours.&nbsp; The
ruff forms a stiff collar, from three to four inches broad, of very
fine stuff, embroidered with gold or silver.&nbsp; The conical head-dress,
resembling a fool&rsquo;s-cap or sugar-loaf, measures two or three feet
high, and is kept in its place by a coarse cloth, and covered with a
finer kerchief.&nbsp; The soleless shoes of ox-hide or sheepskin, made
by the women out of a single piece, are strapped to the instep.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Having made herself generally acquainted with the Icelanders and
their mode of living, Madame Pfeiffer began to visit the most romantic
and interesting spots in the island accessible to an adventurous woman.&nbsp;
At first she confined herself to the neighbourhood of Reikiavik.&nbsp;
She journeyed, for instance, to the island of Vid&ouml;e, the cliffs
of which are frequented by the eider-duck.&nbsp; Its tameness while
brooding is very remarkable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had always looked,&rdquo;
she says, &ldquo;on the wonderful stories I had heard on this subject
as fabulous, and should do still had I not been an eye-witness to the
fact.&nbsp; I approached and laid my hands on the birds while they were
<!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>sitting;
yes, I could even caress them without their attempting to move from
their nests; or, if they left them for a moment, it was only to walk
off for a few steps, and remain quietly waiting till I withdrew, when
they immediately returned to their station.&nbsp; Those whose young
were already hatched, however, would beat their wings with violence,
and snap at me with their bills when I came near them, rather allowing
themselves to be seized than to desert their broods.&nbsp; In size they
resemble our common duck; their eggs are of a greenish-gray, rather
larger than hens&rsquo; eggs, and of an excellent flavour.&nbsp; Each
bird lays about eleven eggs.&nbsp; The finest down is that with which
they line their nests at first; it is of a dark gray, and is regularly
carried off by the islanders with the first eggs.&nbsp; The poor bird
then robs itself of a second portion of its down, and lays a few more
eggs, which are also seized; and it is not till the nest has been felted
for the third time that the ducks are left unmolested to bring up their
brood.&nbsp; The down of the second, and particularly that of the third
hatching, is much lighter than the first, and of an inferior quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The salmon-fishery at the Larsalf next engaged our traveller&rsquo;s
attention.&nbsp; It is conducted after a <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>primitively
simple fashion.&nbsp; When the fish at spawning-time seek the quiet
waters of the inland stream, their way back to the sea is blocked up
by an embankment of loose stones, about three feet high.&nbsp; In front
of this wall is extended a net; and several similar barriers are erected
at intervals of eighty to a hundred paces, to prevent the fish which
have slipped over one of them from finally accomplishing their escape.&nbsp;
A day is appointed for a grand <i>battue</i>.&nbsp; The water is then
let off as much as possible; and the ensnared fish, feeling it grow
shallower, dart hither and thither in frantic confusion, and eventually
gather together in such a mass that the fishermen have only to thrust
in their hands and seize their prey.</p>
<p>Yet <i>some</i> degree of skill is necessary, for, as everybody knows,
the salmon is full of vivacity, and both strong and swift.&nbsp; So
the fisher takes his victim dexterously by head and tail, and throws
it ashore immediately.&nbsp; It is caught up by persons who are specially
appointed to this duty, and flung to a still greater distance from the
stream.&nbsp; Were not this done, and done quickly, many a fine fellow
would escape.&nbsp; It is strange to see the fish turn round in the
hands of their captors, and leap into the air, <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>so
that if the fishermen were not provided with woollen mittens, they could
not keep their hold of the slippery creatures at all.&nbsp; In these
wholesale razzias, from five hundred to a thousand fish are generally
taken at a time, each one weighing from five to fifteen pounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page145.jpg">
<img alt="Salmon-fishing in Iceland" src="images/page145.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Iceland may, with little exaggeration, be described as nothing more
than a stratum of snow and ice overlying a mass of fire and vapour and
boiling water.&nbsp; Nowhere else do we see the two elements of frost
and fire in such immediate contiguity.&nbsp; The icy plains are furrowed
by lower currents, and in the midst of wastes of snow rise the seething
ebullitions of hot springs.&nbsp; Several of the snow-shrouded mountains
of Iceland are volcanic.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood of Kriservick Madame
Pfeiffer saw a long, wide valley, traversed by a current of lava, half
a mile in length; a current consisting not merely of isolated blocks
and stones, but of large masses of porous rock, ten or twelve feet high,
frequently broken up by fissures a foot wide.</p>
<p>Six miles further, and our traveller entered another valley, where,
from the sulphur-springs and hills, rose numerous columns of smoke.&nbsp;
Ascending <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>the
neighbouring hills, she saw a truly remarkable scene: basins filled
with bubbling waters, and vaporous shafts leaping up from the fissures
in the hills and plains.&nbsp; By keeping to windward, she was able
to approach very near these phenomenal objects; the ground was lukewarm
in a few places, and she could hold her hand for several minutes at
a time over the cracks whence the vapour escaped.&nbsp; No water was
visible.&nbsp; The roar and hiss of the steam, combined with the violence
of the wind, made a noise so deafening that she was glad to quit the
scene, and feel a safer soil beneath her feet.&nbsp; It seemed to her
excited fancy as if the entire mountain were converted into a boiling
caldron.</p>
<p>Descending into the plain, she found there much to interest her.&nbsp;
Here a basin was filled with boiling mud; there, from another basin,
burst forth a column of steam with fearful violence.&nbsp; Several hot
springs bubbled and bubbled around.&nbsp; &ldquo;These spots,&rdquo;
says our traveller, &ldquo;were far more dangerous than any on the hills;
in spite of the utmost caution, we often sank in above our ankles, and
drew back our feet in dread, covered with the damp exhalations, which,
with steam or boiling water, also escaped from the opening.&nbsp; I
allowed my guide to feel his <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>way
in front of me with a stick; but, notwithstanding his precaution, he
went through in one place half-way to his knee&mdash;though he was so
used to the danger that he treated it very lightly, and stopped quite
phlegmatically at the next spring to cleanse himself from the mud.&nbsp;
Being also covered with it to the ankles, I followed his example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We must now accompany our traveller on some longer excursions.</p>
<p>And first, to Thingvalla, the place where, of old, the Althing or
island-parliament was annually held.&nbsp; One side of the great valley
of council is bounded by the sea, the other by a fine range of peaks,
always more or less covered with snow.&nbsp; Through the pass of the
Almannagja we descend upon the Thingvallavatn lake, an expanse of placid
blue, about thirty miles in circuit.&nbsp; While our attention is rivetted
on the lake and the dark brown hills which encircle it, a chasm suddenly,
and as if by enchantment, opens at our feet, separating us from the
valleys beyond.&nbsp; It varies from thirty to forty feet in width,
is several hundred feet in depth, and four miles in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were compelled,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer, &ldquo;to
<!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>descend
its steep and dangerous sides by a narrow path leading over fragments
of lava.&nbsp; My uneasiness increased as we went down, and could see
the colossal masses, in the shape of pillars or columns tottering loosely
on the brink of the precipice above our heads, threatening death and
desolation at any moment.&nbsp; Mute and anxious, we crept along in
breathless haste, scarcely venturing to raise our eyes, much less to
give vent to the least expression of alarm, for fear of starting the
avalanche of stone, of the impetuous force of which we could form some
idea by the shattered rocks around us.&nbsp; The echo is very remarkable,
and gives back the faintest whisper with perfect distinctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Every traveller to Iceland feels bound to visit its Geysirs, and
Madame Pfeiffer did as others did.&nbsp; From Thingvalla she rode for
some distance along the side of the lakes, and then struck through a
rocky pass of a very difficult character, into a series of valleys of
widely different aspect.&nbsp; At last she came to a stream which flowed
over a bed of lava, and between banks of lava, with great rapidity and
a rushing, roaring sound.&nbsp; At one point the river-bed was cleft
through its centre, to the depth of <!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>eighteen
or twenty feet, by a chasm from fifteen to eighteen feet wide, into
which the waters pour with considerable violence.&nbsp; A bridge in
the middle of the river spans this rift, and the stranger who reaches
the banks feels unable to account for its appearance among the cloud
of spray which entirely conceals the chasm in the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>Into her description of the passage of the river it is to be feared
that Madame Pfeiffer introduces a little exaggeration.&nbsp; The waters
roar, she says, with the utmost violence, and dashing wildly into the
cavity, they form falls on both sides of it, or shiver themselves to
spray against the projecting cliffs; at the extremity of the chasm,
which is not far from the bridge, the stream is precipitated in its
whole breadth over rocks from thirty to forty feet in height.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our horses began to tremble, and struggled to escape when we
drew near the most furious part of the torrent, where the noise was
really deafening; and it was not without the greatest difficulty we
succeeded in making them obey the reins, and bear us through the foaming
waves by which the bridge was washed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Either the scene
has greatly altered since Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit, or her imagination
has considerably <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>over-coloured
its principal features.&nbsp; That is, if we accept the accounts of
recent travellers, and especially that of Captain Burton, who has laboured
so successfully to reduce the romance of Icelandic travel to plain matter
of fact.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page153.jpg">
<img alt="Great Geysir" src="images/page153.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Geysirs lie within a comparatively limited area, and consist
of various specimens, differing considerably in magnitude.&nbsp; The
basin of the Great Geysir lies on a gentle elevation, about ten feet
above the plain; it measures about one hundred and fifty feet in diameter,
while that of the seething caldron is ten feet.&nbsp; Both caldron and
basin, on the occasion of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit, were full to
the brim with crystal-clear water in a state of slight ebullition.&nbsp;
At irregular intervals a column of water is shot perpendicularly upwards
from the centre of the caldron, the explosion being always preceded
by a low rumbling; but she was not so fortunate as to witness one of
these eruptions.&nbsp; Lord Dufferin, however, after three days&rsquo;
watch, was rewarded for his patience.&nbsp; The usual underground thunder
having been heard, he and his friends rushed to the spot.&nbsp; A violent
agitation was convulsing the centre of the pool.&nbsp; Suddenly a crystal
dome lifted itself up to the height of eight or ten <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>feet,
and then fell; immediately after which, a shining liquid column, or
rather a sheaf of columns, wreathed in robes of vapour, sprang into
the air, and in a succession of jerking leaps, each higher than its
predecessor, flung their silver crests against the sky.&nbsp; For a
few minutes the fountain held its own, then all at once appeared to
lose its ascending power.&nbsp; The unstable waters faltered, drooped,
fell, &ldquo;like a broken purpose,&rdquo; back upon themselves, and
were immediately absorbed in the depths of the subterranean shaft.</p>
<p>About one hundred and forty yards distant is the Strokkr, or &ldquo;churn,&rdquo;
with a basin about seven feet wide in its outer, and eighteen feet in
its inner diameter.&nbsp; A funnel or inverted cone in shape, whereas
the Great Geysir is a mound and a cylinder, it gives the popular idea
of a crater.&nbsp; Its surface is &ldquo;an ugly area of spluttering
and ever boiling water.&rdquo;&nbsp; It frequently &ldquo;erupts,&rdquo;
and throws a spout into the air, sometimes as high as forty or fifty
feet, the outbursts lasting from ten to thirty minutes.&nbsp; Madame
Pfeiffer had not the luck to see it in its grandest moods; the highest
eruption she saw did not rise above thirty feet, nor last more than
fifteen minutes.&nbsp; An eruption can be produced <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>by
throwing into the caldron a sufficient quantity of turf or stones.</p>
<p>Two remarkable springs lie directly above the Geysirs, in openings
separated by a barrier of rock&mdash;which, however, rise nowhere above
the level of the ground.&nbsp; Their waters boil very gently, with an
equable and almost rhythmic flow.&nbsp; The charm of these springs lies
in their wonderful transparency and clearness.&nbsp; All the prominent
points and corners, the varied outlines of the cavities, and the different
recesses, can be distinguished far within the depths, until the eye
is lost in the darkness of the abyss; and the luminous effects upon
the rocks lend an additional beauty to the scene, which has all the
magic of the poet&rsquo;s fairy-land.&nbsp; It is illumined by a radiance
of a soft pale blue and green, which reaches only a few inches from
the rocky barrier, leaving the waters beyond in colourless transparency.&nbsp;
The light, to all appearance, seems reflected from the rock, but is
really owing to atmospheric causes.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From the Geysirs, Madame Pfeiffer proceeded towards Hekla; and at
the village of Thorf&uuml;stadir, on the route, had an opportunity of
seeing an Icelandic <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>funeral.&nbsp;
On entering the church she found the mourners consoling themselves with
a dram of brandy.&nbsp; On the arrival of the priest, a psalm or prayer
was screamed, under his direction, by a chosen number of the congregation;
each shouting his loudest, until he was completely out of breath.&nbsp;
The priest, standing by the coffin, which, for lack of better accommodation,
was resting on one of the seats, read in a loud voice a prayer of more
than half an hour&rsquo;s duration.&nbsp; The body was then borne to
the grave, which was one of remarkable depth; and the coffin being duly
lowered, the priest threw earth upon it thrice, thus terminating the
ceremony.</p>
<p>At the little village of Skalholt, where the first Icelandic bishopric
was established in 1095, Madame Pfeiffer was invited to visit the church,
and inspect its treasures.&nbsp; She was shown the grave of the first
bishop, Thorlak&uacute;r, whose memory is cherished as that of a saint;
an old embroidered robe, and a plain gold chalice, both of which probably
belonged to him; and, in an antique chest, some dusty books in the Iceland
dialect, besides three ponderous folios in German, containing the letters,
epistles, and treatises of Martin Luther.</p>
<p>Continuing her journey, she arrived at the little <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>village
of S&auml;lsun, which lies at the foot of Mount Hekla.&nbsp; Here she
secured the services of a guide, and made preparations for the ascent
of the famous volcano.&nbsp; These included the purchase of a store
of bread and cheese, and the supply of a bottle of water for herself,
and one of brandy for the guide, besides long sticks, shod with iron,
to steady the adventurers&rsquo; footsteps.</p>
<p>The day fixed for the expedition opened brightly and warmly.&nbsp;
At first the road led through fields of tolerable fertility, covered
with a rich green herbage, soft as velvet; and then traversed patches
of black sand, surrounded by hills, and blocks, and currents of lava.&nbsp;
By degrees it grew more difficult, and was so encumbered with lava as
greatly to impede the progress of the travellers.&nbsp; Around and behind
them rolled the dark congealed lava; and it was needful to be constantly
on the watch, to prevent themselves from stumbling, or to avoid rude
contact with the rolling rocks.&nbsp; Greater still was the danger in
the rifts and gorges filled with snow moistening already in the summer
heat; here they frequently broke through the deceptive crust, or at
every step slipped backwards almost as far as they had advanced.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page159.jpg">
<img alt="Mount Hekla" src="images/page159.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>At
length they reached a point where it became necessary to leave behind
the horses, and trust entirely to their own strength.&nbsp; Laboriously,
but undauntedly, Madame Pfeiffer pressed upward.&nbsp; Yet, as she looked
around on the sterile scene, which seemed to have been swept by a blast
of fire, and on the drear expanse of black lava that surrounded her,
Madame Pfeiffer could scarcely repress a sensation of pain and terror.</p>
<p>They had still, she says, three heights to climb; the last of which
was also the most dangerous.&nbsp; The path clambered up the rocks which
covered the entire area of the mountain-summit.&nbsp; Frequent were
our traveller&rsquo;s falls; her hands were sadly wounded by the sharp
jagged projections of the lava; and her eyes suffered severely from
the dazzling brilliancy of the snow that filled every gorge and ravine.</p>
<p>But every obstacle gives way to the resolute; and at last Madame
Pfeiffer stood on the topmost peak of Hekla.&nbsp; Here she made a discovery:
in books of travel she had read of the crater of Mount Hekla, but a
careful survey convinced her that none existed.&nbsp; There was neither
opening, crevasse, nor sunken wall; in fact, no sign of a crater.&nbsp;
Lower down on the mountain-side she detected some wide <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>fissures;
and from these, not from any crater, must have rolled the lava-rivers.&nbsp;
The height of the mountain is computed at 5110 feet.</p>
<p>During the last hour of the ascent the sun had been veiled in mists,
and from the neighbouring glaciers dense clouds now poured down upon
them, obscuring or concealing the entire prospect.&nbsp; Fortunately,
they gradually dissolved into snow, which spread a carpet, white and
soft and glittering, over the dreary lava.&nbsp; The thermometer stood
at 29&frac34;&deg; F.</p>
<p>The snow-storm passed, and the sun once more gladdened earth, and
filled with light the clear blue arch of the firmament.&nbsp; On her
elevated watchtower stood the adventurous traveller, till the clouds,
passing away, opened up to her wondering gaze the glorious view&mdash;glorious,
yet terrible!&nbsp; It seemed as if the ruins of a burned-up world lay
all around: the wastes were strewn with masses of lava; of life not
a sign was visible; blocks of barren lava were piled upon one another
in chaotic confusion; and vast streams of indurated volcanic matter
choked up every valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, on the topmost peak of Hekla,&rdquo; writes Madame Pfeiffer,
&ldquo;I could look down far and wide upon the uninhabited land, the
image of a torpid <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>nature,
passionless, inanimate, and yet sublime,&mdash;an image which, once
seen, can never be forgotten, and the remembrance of which will compensate
me amply for all the toils and difficulties I have endured.&nbsp; A
whole world of glaciers, lava-peaks, fields of snow and ice, rivers
and miniature lakes, were comprehended in that magnificent prospect;
and the foot of man had never yet ventured within these regions of gloom
and solitude.&nbsp; How terrible must have been the resistless fury
of the element which has produced all these changes!&nbsp; And is its
rage now silenced for ever?&nbsp; Will it be satisfied with the ruin
it has wrought?&nbsp; Or does it slumber only to break forth again with
renewed strength, and lay waste those few cultivated spots which are
scattered so sparingly throughout the land?&nbsp; I thank God that he
has allowed me to see this chaos of his creation; and I doubly thank
him that my lot was cast in these fair plains where the sun does more
than divide the day from the night; where it warms and animates plant-life
and animal-life; where it awakens in the heart of man the deepest feelings
of gratitude towards his Maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her way down our traveller discovered that the snow had not melted
for the first five or six <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>hundred
feet.&nbsp; Below that distance the mountain-sides were enveloped in
a shroud of vapour.&nbsp; That glossy, coal-black, shining lava, which
is never porous, can be found only at Hekla and in its immediate vicinity;
but the other varieties, jagged, porous, and vitrified, are also met
with, though they are invariably black, as is the sand which covers
the side of the mountain.&nbsp; As the distance from the volcano increases,
the lava loses its jet-black colour, and fades into an iron-gray.</p>
<p>After an absence of twelve hours, Madame Pfeiffer reached S&auml;lsun
in safety.</p>
<p>Six-and-twenty eruptions of Hekla have been recorded,&mdash;the last
having occurred in 1845-46.&nbsp; One was prolonged for a period of
six years, spreading desolation over a country which had formerly been
the seat of a prosperous settlement, and burying the cultivated fields
beneath a flood of lava, scori&aelig;, and ashes.&nbsp; During the eruption
of 1845-46, three new crater-vents were formed, from which sprang columns
of fire and smoke to the height of 14,000 feet.&nbsp; The lava accumulated
in formidable masses, and fragments of scori&aelig; and pumice-stone
weighing two hundredweight were thrown to a distance of a league and
a half; while the ice and snow <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>which
had lain on the mountain for centuries were liquefied, and rolled in
devastating torrents over the plains.</p>
<p>Hekla is not the only volcanic mountain of Iceland.&nbsp; Mounts
Leirhnukr and Krabla, in the northeast, are very formidable; and one
of the most terrible eruptions recorded in the island annals was that
of the Skapt&aacute; Jokul in 1783.</p>
<p>We have now completed our summary of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s Icelandic
excursions.&nbsp; From the country we may pass to its inhabitants, and
ascertain the deliberate opinion she had formed of them after an experience
extending over several weeks, and under conditions which enabled so
shrewd an observer as she was to judge them impartially.&nbsp; Her estimate
of their character is decidedly less favourable than that of her predecessors;
but it is to be noted that in almost every particular it is confirmed
by the latest authority, Captain Burton.&nbsp; And the evidence goes
to show that they are not the simple, generous, primitive, guileless
Arcadians which it had pleased some fanciful minds to portray.</p>
<p>Their principal occupation consists in the fisheries, which are pursued
with the greatest activity during the months of February, March, and
April.&nbsp; The <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>people
from the interior then stream into the different harbours, and bargain
with the coast-population, the fishermen proper, to help them for a
share of the profits.&nbsp; On the other hand, in July and August many
of the coast-population penetrate inland, and lend their services in
the hay-harvest, for which they are paid in butter, wool, and salted
lamb.&nbsp; Others resort to the mountains in search of Iceland moss,
which they mix with milk, and use as an article of food; or grind it
into meal, and make cakes with it, as a substitute for bread.&nbsp;
The labours of the women consist in preparing the fish for drying, smoking,
or salting; in tending the cattle, in knitting, and gathering moss.&nbsp;
During the winter season both men and women knit uninterruptedly.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer thinks their hospitality has been overrated, and
gives them credit for the ability to make a good bargain.&nbsp; In fact,
she saw nothing of that disinterestedness which Dr. Henderson and other
travellers have ascribed to them.&nbsp; They are intolerably addicted
to brandy-drinking,&mdash;indeed, their circumstances would greatly
improve if they drank less and worked more.&nbsp; They are scarcely
less passionately addicted to snuff-taking, as well as to tobacco-chewing.&nbsp;
Their mode of taking snuff is <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>peculiar,
and certainly not one to be imitated.&nbsp; Most of the peasants, and
even many of the priests, have no snuff-boxes, but make use instead
of a piece of bone, turned in the shape of a little powder-horn.&nbsp;
When desirous of indulging in a little titillation, they throw back
their heads, and putting the point of the horn to their nostril, empty
in the snuff.&nbsp; So little fastidious are these devotees, that they
frequently pass on a horn from nose to nose, without the needless formality
of cleaning it.&nbsp; The mention of this practice leads Madame Pfeiffer
to comment very severely on the want of cleanliness among the Icelanders,
who are as dirty in their houses as in their persons.</p>
<p>They are also remarkable for their laziness.&nbsp; There are many
ample stretches of meadow-land at a short distance from the coast, completely
covered with bog, and passable only with great precautions, which the
construction of a few ditches would thoroughly drain.&nbsp; Capital
grass would then spring up in abundant crops.&nbsp; It is well known
that such will grow in Iceland, for the hillocks which rise above the
swamps are luxuriantly overgrown with herbage and wild clover.&nbsp;
The best soil is found, it is said, on the north side of the island,
where potatoes grow very well, and also a few trees&mdash;which, however,
do <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>not
exceed seven or eight feet in height.&nbsp; The chief occupation of
the northerners is cattle-breeding, particularly in the interior, where
some of the farmers own three or four hundred sheep, ten or fifteen
cows, and a dozen horses.&nbsp; These, it is true, are exceptional cases;
but, as a rule, the population here are in much better circumstances
than the wretched coast-population, who chiefly rely on the products
of their fisheries.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From Iceland Madame Pfeiffer embarked for Copenhagen on the 29th
of July, in the sloop <i>Haabet</i> (the &ldquo;Hope&rdquo;), which
proved by no means a vessel of luxurious accommodation.&nbsp; Our resolute
voyager gives an amusing account of her trials.&nbsp; The fare, for
instance, was better adapted for a hermit than for a lady of gentle
nurture; but it was sublimely impartial, being exactly the same for
captain, mate, crew, and passengers.&nbsp; For breakfast they had wretched
tea,&mdash;or rather, dirty tea-coloured water,&mdash;which the common
hands drank without any sugar.&nbsp; The officers made use of a small
lump of candy, holding it in their mouths, where it melted slowly, while
they swallowed cup after cup to moisten the hard ship-biscuit and rancid
butter.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>The
dinners, however, showed a daily variation.&nbsp; First, a piece of
salted meat, which, having been soaked and boiled in sea-water, was
so intolerably hard, tough, and salt that it required the digestion
of an ostrich to overtake it.&nbsp; Instead of soup, vegetables, or
dessert, barley grits were served up, plainly boiled, without salt or
butter, and eaten with syrup and vinegar.&nbsp; On the second day, the
<i>pi&egrave;ce de resistance</i> was a lump of bacon, boiled in salt
water; this was followed by the barley grits.&nbsp; On the third day,
cod-fish and pease; on the fourth, the same bill of fare as on the first;
and so on,&mdash;a cup of coffee, without milk, closing the noonday
meal.&nbsp; The evening&rsquo;s repast resembled that of the morning,
consisting of tea-water and ship-biscuit.</p>
<p>So much for the fare.&nbsp; As to the &ldquo;table appointments,&rdquo;
they were miserably meagre.&nbsp; The cloth was a piece of an old sail,
so soiled and dirty that it effectually deprived Madame Pfeiffer and
her fellow-passengers of any small appetite with which they might have
sat down to dinner.&nbsp; Madame Pfeiffer began to think that it would
be better to have no cloth at all.&nbsp; She was mistaken!&nbsp; One
day she saw the steward belabouring a piece of sailcloth, which was
stretched on the deck under his feet, to <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>receive
a good sweeping from the ship&rsquo;s broom.&nbsp; The numerous spots
of dirt and grease showed plainly that it was the table-cloth; and that
same evening the table was bare.&nbsp; The consequence was, that the
teapot had no sooner been placed upon it than it began to slide; and
nothing but the captain&rsquo;s adroitness prevented the entire &ldquo;bill
of fare&rdquo; from being poured into the laps of the guests.&nbsp;
It then became evident that</p>
<blockquote><p>A table-cloth all foul and stained <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is better far than none at all!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Hope</i> was twenty days at sea, and for twelve days out of
sight of land.&nbsp; She was wind-driven to the westward, so that her
passengers saw but few of the monsters of the Northern Seas.&nbsp; They
caught sight of the spout of a single whale in the distance; it rose
in the air exactly like a fountain-jet, but the animal itself was too
far off for its huge outlines to be discernible.&nbsp; One shark had
the gallantry to swim round them for a few minutes, affording them an
opportunity of observing it closely.&nbsp; It appeared to be from sixteen
to eighteen feet in length.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The &ldquo;unresting&rdquo; traveller reached Copenhagen <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>on
the 19th of August, and on the very same day embarked again for Sweden
and Norway.</p>
<p>Let us accompany her to Christiania.&nbsp; This town and its suburbs,
the fortress, the royal castle, the freemasons&rsquo; lodge, and other
buildings, surmount the noble harbour in a stately semicircle; which,
in its turn, is enclosed by meadows, and woods, and green hills.&nbsp;
As if loath to leave a scene so charming, the blue sea winds in among
the fields and vales to some distance behind the town.</p>
<p>The best part of Christiania is, not unnaturally, the latest built,
where the streets are broad and long, and the houses, both of brick
and stone, substantial.&nbsp; In the suburbs, most of the houses are
of timber.&nbsp; Some of the public edifices are architecturally conspicuous,
particularly the new castle and the fortress, which are finely situated
on a commanding elevation, and enjoy a prospect of great extent and
splendid variety.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer was much struck by the diverseness of the conveyances
that dash through the pleasant, breezy streets of this picturesque city.&nbsp;
The most common, but the least convenient, are called <i>carriols</i>.&nbsp;
They consist of a very long, narrow, and uncovered box, strung between
two enormously high wheels, <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>and
provided with a very small seat, into which the passenger must squeeze
himself, with outstretched feet, and a leathern apron drawn over his
legs; nor can he, nor dare he, move, from the moment he gets in until
he gets out again.&nbsp; A place behind is provided for the coachman,
in case the occupant of the <i>carriol</i> is disinclined to drive;
but as it is unpleasant to have the reins shaken about one&rsquo;s head,
and the whip constantly flourishing in one&rsquo;s ears, the services
of a driver are seldom in requisition.&nbsp; Besides these unshapely
vehicles, there are phaetons, droschkis, chariots, and similar light
conveyances; but no covered carriages.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From Christiania to Stockholm.</p>
<p>At Gothenburg Madame Pfeiffer embarked on board the steamer which
plies on the G&ouml;tha Canal, the great water-way, linking streams
and lakes, which affords access to the Swedish capital.&nbsp; She found
herself before long on the River G&ouml;tha, and at Lilla Edet came
to the first of the five locks which occur there.&nbsp; While the boat
was passing through them she had an opportunity of seeing the G&ouml;tha
Falls, which, though of no great height, pour down a considerable volume
of water.</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Through
fir woods, brown with shadows, the canal winds onward to the magnificent
locks of Trollhatten&mdash;an engineering achievement of which any nation
might be justly proud.&nbsp; They are eleven in number, and rise by
gradations to a height of 112 feet in a distance of 3550 feet.&nbsp;
The wide, deep channel excavated in the rock is literally paved with
flagstones; and these locks mount one above the other like the solitary
steps of a majestic stairway, and almost lay claim to be ranked among
the world&rsquo;s wonders.</p>
<p>While the steamer passes through the successive barriers the passengers
have time to make an excursion to the falls of Trollhatten, which are
less remarkable for their elevation than for their flood of waters and
the picturesqueness of the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>Beyond Trollhatten the stream expands to the proportions of a lake,
while a number of green and wooded islands divide it into several channels.&nbsp;
Thence it traverses the Lake of Wenner, which is ten or twelve miles
long, and proceeds onward through a country of no great interest, until
at Sjotorp it passes into the river again.&nbsp; A few miles further,
and it crosses the Vilkensoc, which, like all <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the
other Swedish lakes, is charmingly studded with islands.&nbsp; It lies
three hundred and six feet above the level of the North Sea, and is
the culminating point of the canal, which thence descends through about
seventy locks, traversing the Bottensee and Lake Wetter.</p>
<p>After a tedious journey of five days, Madame Pfeiffer reached the
shores of the Baltic, which are finely indented by bays and rivers,
with long stretches of lofty cliff, and, inland, dense masses of fir
woods.&nbsp; Leaving the sea again, a short canal conducts the voyager
into Lake M&auml;lar, celebrated for its cluster of islands.&nbsp; The
lake at first resembles a broad river, but soon widens to a great extent;
the beauty of the scenery never fails to excite the traveller&rsquo;s
admiration.&nbsp; It is said that a thousand isles besprinkle its surface;
they are crowded together in the most picturesque and varied groups,
forming streams, and bays, and a chain of smaller lakes, and continually
revealing some new and attractive feature.</p>
<p>Not less charming the shores: sometimes the hills and mountains pass
close to the water, and their steep and rocky sides frown like thunder-smitten
ramparts; but generally the eye is delighted <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>by
a constant and brightly-coloured panorama of meadows, woods, and valleys,
villages, and sequestered farmhouses.&nbsp; On the summit of a steep
declivity a high pole is erected, to which hangs suspended the hat of
the unfortunate King Erik.&nbsp; It is said of him, that having fled
from the field of battle, he was here overtaken by one of his soldiers,
whose stern reproaches so stung him to the heart that he drove his spurs
into his horse&rsquo;s sides, and clearing the precipice with a bound,
sank for ever beneath the waters of the lake.&nbsp; His hat, which fell
from his head as he made the plunge, is preserved as a memorial of a
king&rsquo;s remorse.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On arriving at Stockholm, several stalwart women offer us their services
as porters.&nbsp; They are Dalecarlians, who earn a livelihood by carrying
luggage or water, by rowing boats, and by resorting to other occupations
generally reserved for the stronger sex.&nbsp; Honest, industrious,
capable of immense fatigue, they never lack employment.&nbsp; They wear
short black petticoats, red bodices, white chemises with long sleeves,
short and narrow aprons of two colours, red stockings, and shoes with
thick wooden soles.&nbsp; Around their heads they generally bind a <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>handkerchief,
or else wear a very small black cap, which just covers the back of their
hair.</p>
<p>Stockholm proves, on examination, to be a handsome city, situated
at the junction of the Baltic with the Lake M&auml;lar; or, more strictly
speaking, on the banks of a short canal which unites the two.&nbsp;
One of its most conspicuous buildings is the stately Ritterholm Church,
which Madame Pfeiffer describes as resembling rather a vault and an
armoury than a religious edifice.&nbsp; In the side chapels are enshrined
the monuments of dead Swedish kings, whose bones lie in the royal sepulchres
below.&nbsp; On both sides of the nave are ranged the equestrian statues
of armed knights; while from every vantage-point hang flags and standards.&nbsp;
The keys of captured towns and fortresses are suspended in the side
chapels, and drums and kettle-drums piled upon the floor&mdash;trophies
won from the enemies of Sweden in the days when she was a great European
power.&nbsp; The chapels also contain, enclosed in glass-cases, parts
of the dress and armour of some of the Swedish monarchs.&nbsp; We notice,
with keen interest, the uniform worn by Charles XII.&mdash;he</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who left a name at which the world grew pale,
<br />
To point a moral or adorn a tale&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>at
the time of his death, and the hat penetrated by the fatal shot that
slew the fiery warrior.&nbsp; A remarkable contrast is afforded by the
rich dress and plumed hat of Bernadotte, the French soldier of fortune,
who founded the present royal house.</p>
<p>The royal palace is a stately structure, and its interior is enriched
with the costliest decoration.&nbsp; The Ritter-house, the Museum of
Ancient Art, the Crown-Prince&rsquo;s palace, the theatre, the bank,
the mint, are all deserving of inspection.&nbsp; In the vicinity a trip
may be made to the beautiful and diversified scenery of the Royal Park,
or the military school at Karlberg, or to the ancient royal castle of
Gripsholm on the Lake of M&auml;lar.</p>
<p>But our last excursion must be directed, by way of Upsala, to the
iron-mines of Danemora.</p>
<p>The little village of Danemora is embosomed in woods.&nbsp; It contains
a small church and a few scattered houses of various dimensions.&nbsp;
The neighbourhood abounds in the usual indications of a mining locality.&nbsp;
Madame Pfeiffer arrived in what is called &ldquo;the nick of time,&rdquo;
and just opportunely, to witness the blasting of the ore.&nbsp; From
the wide opening of the largest mine it is possible to see what passes
below; and a strange and wonderful sight it <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>is
to peer down into the abyss, four hundred and eighty feet deep, and
observe the colossal entrances to the various pits, the rocky bridges,
the projections, arches, and caverns excavated in the solid rock.&nbsp;
The miners appear so many puppets; their movements can hardly be distinguished,
until the eye has grown accustomed to the darkness and to their diminutive
size.</p>
<p>At the given moment a match was applied to four trains of gunpowder.&nbsp;
The man who lighted them immediately sprang back, and hid himself behind
a wall of rock.&nbsp; In a minute or two came the flash; a few stones
were hurled into the air; and immediately afterwards was heard a loud
detonation, and the shattered mass fell in fragments all around.&nbsp;
Echo caught up the tremendous explosion, and carried it to the furthest
recesses of the mine; while, to enhance the terror of the scene, one
rock was hardly shivered before another crash was heard, and then a
third, and immediately afterwards a fourth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page179.jpg">
<img alt="Iron-mine of Danemora" src="images/page179.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The other pits are still deeper, one of them being six hundred feet
beneath the ground; but as they are smaller in their openings, and as
the shafts are not always perpendicular, the gaze is soon lost in <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>the
obscurity, which produces a dismal effect upon the spectator.&nbsp;
The iron obtained from the Swedish mines is of excellent quality, and
large quantities are annually exported.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer now began her homeward journey, and, by way of Hamburg
and Berlin, proceeded to Dresden.&nbsp; Thence she returned to Vienna
on the 6th of October, after an absence of six months.</p>
<h2><!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>CHAPTER
IV.&mdash;LAST TRAVELS.</h2>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer set out on what proved to be her final expedition,
on the 21st of May 1856.&nbsp; She proceeded to Berlin, thence to Amsterdam,
Leyden, Rotterdam; visited London and Paris; and afterwards undertook
the voyage to the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp; Here she hesitated for a
while in what direction she should turn her adventurous steps before
she pushed forward to the goal of her hopes&mdash;Madagascar.&nbsp;
At length she decided on a visit to the Mauritius; and it is at this
part of her journey that we propose to take up her record.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/page183.jpg">
<img alt="Port Louis, Mauritius" src="images/page183.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>She saw much scenery in this rich and beautiful little island that
moved her to admiration.&nbsp; The volcanic mountains assume the boldest
and most romantic outlines.&nbsp; The vegetation is of the most <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>luxuriant
character.&nbsp; Each deep gorge or mountain-valley blooms with foliage;
and the slopes are clothed with stately trees, graceful shrubs, and
climbing plants; while shining streams fall from crag to crag in miniature
cascades.&nbsp; Of course Madame Pfeiffer visited the sugar-cane plantations,
which cover the broad and fertile plains of Pamplemousse.&nbsp; She
learned that the sugar-cane is not raised from seed, but that pieces
of cane are planted.&nbsp; The first cane requires eighteen months to
ripen; but as, meanwhile, the chief stem throws out shoots, each of
the following harvests can be gathered in at intervals of twelve months;
hence four crops can be obtained in four years and a half.&nbsp; After
the fourth harvest, the field must be cleared completely of the cane.&nbsp;
If the land be virgin soil, on which no former crop has been raised,
fresh slips of cane may be planted immediately, and thus eight crops
secured in nine years.&nbsp; But if such is not the case, &ldquo;ambrezades&rdquo;
must be planted&mdash;that is, a leafy plant, growing to the height
of eight or nine feet, the leaves of which, continually falling, decay
and fertilize the soil.&nbsp; After two years the plants are rooted
out, and the ground is once more occupied by a sugar plantation.</p>
<p>When the canes are ripe and the harvest begins, <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>every
day as many canes are cut down as can be pressed and boiled at once.&nbsp;
The cane is introduced between two rollers, set in motion by steam-power,
and pressed until it is quite flat and dry: in this state it is used
for fuel.&nbsp; The juice is strained successively into six pans, of
which the first is exposed to the greatest heat&mdash;the force of the
fire being diminished gradually under each of the others.&nbsp; In the
last pan the sugar is found half crystallized.&nbsp; It is then deposited
on great wooden tables to cool, and granulate into complete crystals
of about the size of a pin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Lastly, it is poured
into wooden colanders, to filter it thoroughly of the molasses it still
contains.&nbsp; The whole process occupies eight or ten days.&nbsp;
Before the sugar is packed, it is spread out on the open terraces to
dry for some hours in the sun.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>An excursion was made to Mount Orgueil, in order to obtain a panoramic
view of the island-scenery.&nbsp; On one side the lofty ridge of the
Morne Brabant, connected with the mainland only by a narrow neck of
earth, stretches far out into the sapphire sea; near at hand rises the
Piton de la Rivi&egrave;re Noire, the loftiest summit in the island,
two <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>thousand
five hundred and sixty-four feet.&nbsp; In another direction are visible
the green tops of the Tamarin and the Rempart; and in a fourth, the
three-headed mountain called the Trois Mamelles.&nbsp; Contiguous to
these opens a deep caldron, two of the sides of which have broken down
in ruin, while the others remain erect and steep.&nbsp; Besides these
mountains, the traveller sees the Corps de Garde du Port Loris de Mocca;
Le Pouce, with its narrow peak projecting above the plateau like a thumb;
and the precipitous Peter Botte.</p>
<p>The last-named mountain recalls the memory of the daring Hollander
who first reached its summit, long regarded as impracticable.&nbsp;
He succeeded in what seemed a hopeless effort by shooting an arrow,
to which a strong cord was attached, over the top.&nbsp; The arrow fell
on the other side of the mountain, at a point which could be attained
without much difficulty.&nbsp; A stout rope was then fastened to the
cord, drawn over the mountain, and secured on both sides; and Peter
Botte hauled himself up by it to the topmost crest, and thus immortalized
his name.&nbsp; The ascent has since been accomplished by English travellers.</p>
<p>A trip was also undertaken to the Trou de Cerf, <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>or
&ldquo;Stag&rsquo;s Hole,&rdquo; a crater of perfectly regular formation,
brimful of bloom and foliage.&nbsp; As no sign or mark betrays its whereabouts,
the traveller is seized with astonishment on suddenly reaching its brink.&nbsp;
His astonishment soon wears off, and he feels an intense delight in
contemplating the view before him.&nbsp; It comprises three-fourths
of the island: majestic mountains clothed in virgin forests almost to
their very crests; wide-spreading plains, green with the leafiness of
the sugar-cane plantations; cool verdurous valleys, where the drowsy
shadows softly rest; and beyond and around the blue sea with a fringe
of snow-white foam marking the indentations of the coast.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>On the 25th of April 1857 Madame Pfeiffer sailed for Madagascar,
and after a six-days&rsquo; voyage reached the harbour of Tamatav&eacute;.</p>
<p>Madagascar, the reader may be reminded, is, next to Borneo, the largest
island in the world.&nbsp; It is separated from the African mainland
by the Mozambique Channel, only seventy-five miles wide.&nbsp; It stretches
from lat. 12&deg; to 25&deg; S., and long. 40&deg; to 48&deg; E.&nbsp;
Its area is about ten thousand geographical square miles.</p>

contains forests of immense extent, far-reaching plains and valleys,
rivers, lakes, and great chains of mountains, which raise their summits
to an elevation of ten or twelve thousand feet.&nbsp; The climate is
tropical, the vegetation remarkable for abundance and variety.&nbsp;
The chief products are gums and odoriferous balsams, sugar, tobacco,
maize, indigo, silk, spices.&nbsp; The woods yield many valuable kinds
of timber, and almost every fruit of the Torrid Zone, besides the curious
and useful Traveller&rsquo;s Tree.&nbsp; Palms are found in dense and
beautiful groves; and among them is the exquisite water-palm, or lattice
leaf-plant.&nbsp; In the animal kingdom Madagascar possesses some remarkable
forms; as, for instance, the makis, or half-ape, and the black parrot.&nbsp;
The population consists of four distinct races: the Kaffirs, who inhabit
the south; the Negroes, who dwell in the west; the Arabs in the east;
and in the interior the Malays, among whom the Hovas are the most numerous
and the most civilized.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Tamatav&eacute;, when visited by Madame Pfeiffer looked like a poor
but very large village, with between four and five thousand inhabitants.&nbsp;
Of late <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>years,
however, it has grown into a place of much commercial importance.&nbsp;
There are some decent houses; but the natives live chiefly in small
huts, which are scattered over a wide area, with scarcely any attempt
at regularity of arrangement.&nbsp; These huts are supported on piles
from six to ten feet high.&nbsp; They are built of wood or of bamboo,
thatched with long grass or palm-leaves; and they contain only one room,
of which the fireplace occupies a disproportionate share.&nbsp; Windows
are wanting, but light and air are admitted through two opposite doors.</p>
<p>The bazaar is situated in the middle of the village, on an irregular
piece of ground, and is distinguished alike by its dirt and poverty.&nbsp;
The articles exposed for sale are only a supply of beef, some sugar-cane,
rice, and a few fruits; and the whole stock of one of the dealers would
be dear at a couple of shillings.&nbsp; The oxen are slaughtered on
the spot, and their flesh sold in thick hunches, with the skin, which
is esteemed a great delicacy.&nbsp; Meat is not bought according to
weight, but the size of each piece is measured by the eye.</p>
<p>The Tamatavians are principally Malagasys; and, physically, their
appearance does not recommend <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>them.&nbsp;
They have wide mouths, with thick lips; their noses are broad and flat;
their chins protrude; their cheek-bones are disagreeably prominent.&nbsp;
Their complexion may be any shade of a muddy brown.&nbsp; Generally,
their teeth are regular, and very white; but against this redeeming
trait must be put their hideous hair, which is coal-black, very long,
very woolly, and very coarse.&nbsp; When worn in all its natural amplitude,
its effect is curiously disagreeable.&nbsp; The face seems lost in a
&ldquo;boundless convexity&rdquo; of thick frizzled hair, which stands
out in every direction.&nbsp; But, usually, the men cut their hair quite
short at the back of the head, leaving only a length of six or eight
inches in front, which stands upright, like a hedge of wool.&nbsp; Much
pride is felt in their &ldquo;head of hair&rdquo; by the women, and
even by some of the men; and, unwilling to shorten so ornamental an
appendage, they plait it into numerous little tails.&nbsp; Some coquettishly
allow these tails to droop all about their head; others twist them together
into a band or bunch, covering the top of the head like a cap.&nbsp;
No wonder that much time is spent in the preparation of so complex a
head-gear; but then, on the other hand, when once made up it will last
for several days.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Now
as to the costume of these interesting semi-savages.&nbsp; Their articles
of clothing are two in number&mdash;the <i>sadik</i> and the <i>simbre</i>.&nbsp;
The former, which by many natives is considered quite sufficient, is
a strip of cloth worn round the loins.&nbsp; The simbre is a piece of
white stuff, about four yards long and three broad, which is worn much
like a toga.&nbsp; As it is constantly coming loose, and every minute
needing adjustment, it is an exceedingly troublesome though not ungraceful
garment, keeping one hand of the wearer almost constantly employed.</p>
<p>Males and females wear the same attire, except that the latter indulge
in a little more drapery, and often add a third article&mdash;a short
tight jacket, called <i>kanezu</i>.</p>
<p>Simple as is the clothing of the Malagasy, their food is not less
simple.&nbsp; At every meal, rice and anana are the principal or only
dishes.&nbsp; Anana is a vegetable very much like spinach, of a by no
means disagreeable flavour in itself, but not savoury when cooked with
rancid fat.&nbsp; Fish is sometimes eaten, but not often&mdash;for indolence
is a great Malagasy quality&mdash;by those who dwell on the borders
of rivers or on the sea-shore; meat and poultry, though both are cheap,
are eaten only on special occasions.&nbsp; <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>The
natives partake of two meals&mdash;one in the morning, the other in
the evening.</p>
<p>The rice and anana are washed down with <i>ranugang</i>, or rice-water,
thus prepared: Rice is boiled in a vessel, and purposely burned, until
a crust forms at the bottom.&nbsp; The water is poured on, and allowed
to boil.&nbsp; The water in colour resembles pale coffee, and in taste
is abominable to a European palate.&nbsp; The natives, however, esteem
it highly, and not only drink the water, but eat the crust.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>One of the great ceremonies of Madagascar, the royal bath-feast,
is described by Madame Pfeiffer.&nbsp; It is celebrated on the Malagasy
New-Year&rsquo;s Day, and has some curious features.&nbsp; On the eve,
all the high officers, nobles, and chiefs are invited to court; and
assembling in a great hall, partake of a dish of rice, which is handed
round to each guest with much solemnity that he may take a pinch with
his fingers and eat.&nbsp; Next day, all reassemble in the same place;
and the queen steps behind a curtain, which hangs in a corner of the
room, undresses, and submits to copious ablutions.&nbsp; Assuming her
clothes, she comes forward, holding in her hand an ox-horn that has
been filled with water from her bath; and this <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>she
sprinkles over the assembled company&mdash;reserving a portion for the
soldiers drawn up on parade beneath her window.</p>
<p>Throughout the country this day is an occasion of festivity, and
dancing, singing, and feasting are kept up till a late hour.&nbsp; Nor
does the revel end then; it is prolonged for eight days.&nbsp; The people
on the first day are accustomed to kill as many oxen as will supply
them with meat for the whole period; and no man who possesses a herd,
however small, fails to kill at least one for this annual celebration.&nbsp;
The poor exchange rice, and tobacco, and several potatoes, for pieces
of meat.&nbsp; These pieces are long thin strips; and being salted,
and laid one upon another, they keep tolerably well until the eighth
day.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer had an opportunity of witnessing the dances, but
did not find them very interesting.</p>
<p>Some girls beat a little stick with all their might against a thick
stem of bamboo; while others sang, or rather howled, at their highest
and loudest pitch.&nbsp; Then two of the ebony beauties stepped forward,
and began to move slowly to and fro on a small space of ground, half
lifting their arms, and turning their hands, first outwards, and then
towards their <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>sides.&nbsp;
Next, one of the men made his <i>d&eacute;but</i>.&nbsp; He tripped
about much in the same style as the dusky <i>danseuses</i>, only with
greater energy; and each time he approached any of the women or girls,
he made gestures expressive of his love and admiration.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Our traveller obtained permission to enter into the interior of the
island, and to visit Antananarivo, <a name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197">{197}</a>
the capital.&nbsp; As she approached it, she could see it picturesquely
planted on a high hill that rose out of the broad and fertile inland
plain; and after a pleasant journey through rich and beautiful scenery,
she came upon the suburbs, which enclose it on all sides.</p>
<p>The suburbs at first were villages; but they have gradually expanded
until they have been formed into a compact aggregate.&nbsp; Most of
the houses are built of earth or clay; but those belonging to the city
must, by royal decree, be constructed of planks, or at least of bamboo.&nbsp;
They are all of a larger size than the dwellings of the villagers; are
much cleaner, and kept in better condition.&nbsp; The roofs are very
high and steep, with long poles reared at each end by way of ornament.&nbsp;
Many houses, and <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>sometimes
groups of three or four houses, are surrounded by low ramparts of earth,
apparently for no other purpose than to separate the courtyards from
the neighbouring tenements.&nbsp; The streets and squares are all very
irregularly built: the houses are not placed in rows, but in clusters,&mdash;some
at the foot of the hill, others on its slopes.&nbsp; The royal palace
crowns the summit.</p>
<p>Madame Pfeiffer expressing her surprise at the number of lightning-conductors
that everywhere appeared, was informed that perhaps in no other part
of the world were thunderstorms so frequent or so fatal.&nbsp; She was
told that, at Antananarivo, about three hundred people were killed by
lightning every year.</p>
<p>The interior of the town was in appearance exactly like one of the
suburbs, except that the houses were built of planks or of bamboo.</p>
<p>At the time of Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s visit, the sovereign of Madagascar
was Queen Ranavala, memorable for her sanguinary propensities, her hatred
of Europeans, and her persecution of the Christian converts.&nbsp; It
proves the extraordinary power of fascination which our traveller possessed,
that she obtained from this feminine despot so many <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>concessions&mdash;being
allowed to travel about the island with comparative freedom, and being
even admitted to the royal presence.&nbsp; The latter incident is thus
described:&mdash;</p>
<p>Towards four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon her bearers carried Madame
Pfeiffer to the palace, over the door of which a great gilded eagle
expands its wings.&nbsp; According to rule, in stepping across the threshold
the visitor put her right foot foremost; and this ceremony she also
observed on entering, through a second gateway, the spacious courtyard
in front of the palace.&nbsp; Here the queen was visible, being seated
on a balcony on the first story, and Madame Pfeiffer and her attendants
were directed to stand in a row in the courtyard opposite to her.&nbsp;
Under the balcony some soldiers were going through divers evolutions,
which concluded, comically enough, by suddenly lifting up the right
foot as if it had been stung by a wasp.</p>
<p>The queen was attired in a wide silk simbre, and wore on her head
a large golden crown.&nbsp; Though she sat in the shade, a very ample
umbrella of crimson silk&mdash;throughout the East a sign of royal dignity&mdash;was
held over her head.&nbsp; She was of rather dark complexion, strongly
and even sturdily <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>built,
and, though seventy-five years of age, remarkably healthy and active.&nbsp;
On her right stood her son, Prince Rakoto; and on her left, her adopted
son, Prince Ramboasalama.&nbsp; Behind her were gathered nephews, nieces,
and other relatives, and the dignitaries and grandees of her kingdom.</p>
<p>The minister who had conducted Madame Pfeiffer and her companion&mdash;M.
Lambert, a French adventurer, who played a conspicuous part in the affairs
of Madagascar&mdash;addressed a short speech to the queen; after which
the visitors had to bow thrice, and to repeat the words, &ldquo;Esaratsara
tombokoc&rdquo; (We salute you cordially); to which she replied, &ldquo;Esaratsara&rdquo;
(We salute you).&nbsp; They then turned to the left to salute King Radama&rsquo;s
tomb, which was close at hand, with three similar bows; afterwards returning
to their former position in front of the balcony, and making three more.&nbsp;
M. Lambert next held up a gold piece of eighty francs value, and placed
it in the hands of the minister who had introduced them.&nbsp; This
gift, which is expected from every stranger when first presented, is
called &ldquo;Monosina.&rdquo;&nbsp; The queen then asked M. Lambert
if he wished to put any question to her, or if he needed anything, and
also addressed a remark or two to Madame Pfeiffer.&nbsp; <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>The
bowings and greetings were then resumed; obeisance was paid to King
Radama&rsquo;s monument; and the visitors, as they retired, were again
cautioned not to put the left foot first over the threshold.</p>
<p>The royal palace is (or was) a very large timber building, consisting
of a ground-floor and two stories, surmounted by a singularly high-pitched
roof.&nbsp; Each story is surrounded by a broad gallery.&nbsp; The roof
is supported on wooden pillars, eighty feet high, and rises forty feet
above them, resting in the centre on a pillar not less than a hundred
and twenty feet in height.&nbsp; All these columns are fashioned each
from a single trunk; and when it is considered, says our authority,
that the forests containing trees of sufficient size for this purpose
lie fifty or sixty miles from the capital, that the roads are nowhere
paved, and in some places are quite impassable, and that all the pillars
are dragged to the capital without the help of a beast of burden or
any single machine, and are afterwards wrought and set up with the simplest
tools, the erection of this palace may justly be called a gigantic undertaking,
and the palace itself ranked among the wonders of the world.</p>
<p>The government of Madagascar has always been Draconian in its severity,
and the penalty exacted <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>for
almost every offence is blood.&nbsp; Some of the unfortunates are burned;
others are hurled over a high rock; others buried alive; others scalded
to death with boiling water; others killed with the spear; others sewn
up alive in mats, and left to perish of hunger and corruption; and others
beheaded.&nbsp; Recourse is not unfrequently had to poison, which is
used as a kind of ordeal or test.&nbsp; This is applicable to all classes;
and as any one may accuse another, on depositing a certain sum of money,&mdash;and
as, moreover, no accused person is allowed to defend himself,&mdash;the
ordeal does not fall into disrepute for want of use.&nbsp; If the accused
endures it without perishing, a third part of the deposit is awarded
to him, a third part goes to the court, and the remainder is returned
to the accuser.&nbsp; But if the accused die, his guilt is considered
to have been established, and the accuser receives back the whole of
his money.</p>
<p>The poisoning process takes place as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>The material employed is obtained from the kernel of a fruit as large
as a peach, called the <i>Tanghinia venenifera</i>.&nbsp; The lampi-tanghini,
or person who administers the poison, announces to the accused the day
on which the perilous dose is <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>to
be swallowed.&nbsp; For eight-and-forty hours before the prescribed
time he is allowed to eat very little, and for the last twenty-four
hours nothing at all.&nbsp; His friends accompany him to the poisoner&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; There he undresses, and takes oath that he has had no recourse
to magic.&nbsp; The lampi-tanghini then scrapes away as much powder
from the kernel with a knife as he judges necessary for the trial.&nbsp;
Before administering the dose, he asks the accused if he confesses his
crime; which the accused never does, because under any circumstances
he would have to swallow the poison.&nbsp; The said poison is spread
upon three little pieces of skin, each about an inch in size, cut from
the back of a plump fowl.&nbsp; These he rolls together, and administers
to the supposed culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In former days,&rdquo; says Madame Pfeiffer, &ldquo;almost
every person who was subjected to this ordeal died in great agony; but
for the last ten years any one not condemned by the queen herself to
take the tanghin, is allowed to make use of the following antidote.&nbsp;
As soon as he has taken the poison, his friends make him drink rice-water
in such quantities that his whole body sometimes swells visibly, and
quick and violent vomiting is brought on.&nbsp; If the poisoned man
be fortunate enough to get rid not <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>only
of the poison, but of the three little skins (which latter must be returned
uninjured), he is declared innocent, and his relations carry him home
in triumph, with songs and rejoicings.&nbsp; But if one of the pieces
of skin should fail to reappear, or if it be at all injured, his life
is forfeited, and he is executed with the spear, or by some other means.&rdquo;
<a name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204">{204}</a></p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>During Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s stay at Antananarivo a conspiracy
broke out, provoked by the queen&rsquo;s cruelty.&nbsp; It failed, however,
in its object; and those concerned in it were mercilessly punished.&nbsp;
The Christians became anew exposed to the suspicions and wrath of Ranavala;
and Madame Pfeiffer and her companions found themselves in a position
of great peril.&nbsp; The royal council debated vehemently the question,
Whether they should be put to death? and this being answered in the
affirmative, What death they should die?&nbsp; Happily, Prince Rakoto
interfered, pointing out that the murder of Europeans would not be allowed
to pass unavenged, but would bring down upon Madagascar the fleets and
armies of the great European powers.&nbsp; <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>This
argument finally prevailed; and Madame Pfeiffer and the other Europeans,
six in all, then in Antananarivo, were ordered to quit it immediately.&nbsp;
They were only too thankful to escape with their lives, and within an
hour were on their way to Tamatav&eacute;, escorted by seventy Malagasy
soldiers.&nbsp; They had good cause to congratulate themselves on their
escape, for on the very morning of their departure ten Christians had
been put to death with the most terrible tortures.</p>
<p>The journey to Tamatav&eacute; was not without its dangers and difficulties,
and Madame Pfeiffer, who had been attacked with fever, suffered severely.&nbsp;
The escort purposely delayed them on the road; so that, instead of reaching
the coast in eight days, the time actually occupied was three-and-fifty.&nbsp;
This was the more serious, because the road ran through low-lying and
malarious districts.&nbsp; In the most unhealthy spots, moreover, the
travellers were left in wretched huts for a whole week, or even two
weeks; and frequently, when Madame Pfeiffer was groaning in a violent
excess of fever, the brutal soldiers dragged her from her miserable
couch, and compelled her to continue her journey.</p>
<p>At length, on the 12th of September, she arrived <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>at
Tamatav&eacute;; broken-down and unutterably weary and worn, but still
alive.&nbsp; Ill as she was, she gladly embarked on board a ship which
was about to sail for the Mauritius; and reaching that pleasant island
on the 22nd, met with a hearty welcome from her friends&mdash;to whom,
indeed, she was as one who had been dead and was alive again.</p>
<p>The mental and physical sufferings she had undergone, combined with
the peculiar effects of the fever, now brought on an illness of so serious
a character that for long the doctors doubted whether her recovery was
possible.&nbsp; On her sixtieth birthday, the 14th of October, they
pronounced the brave lady out of danger; but, in fact, her constitution
had received a fatal shock.&nbsp; The fever became intermittent in its
attacks, but it never wholly left her; though she continued, with unabated
energy and liveliness, to lay down plans for fresh expeditions.&nbsp;
She had made all her preparations for a voyage to Australia, when a
return of her disease, in February 1858, compelled her to renounce her
intention, and to direct her steps homeward.</p>
<p>Early in the month of June she arrived in London, where she remained
for a few weeks.&nbsp; Thence she repaired to Berlin.</p>
<p><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Her
strength was now declining day by day, though at first she seemed to
regard her illness as only temporary, and against the increasing physical
weakness her mind struggled with its usual activity.&nbsp; About September,
she evinced a keen anxiety to behold her home once more,&mdash;evidently
having arrived at a conviction that her end was near.&nbsp; She was
carefully conveyed to Vienna, and received into the house of her brother,
Charles Reyer; where, at first, the influence of her native air had
an invigorating effect.&nbsp; This gave way after a week or two, and
her illness returned with augmented force.&nbsp; During the last days
of her life, opiates were administered to relieve her sufferings; and
in the night between the 27th and 28th of October she passed away peacefully,
and apparently without pain,&mdash;leaving behind her the memory of
a woman of matchless intrepidity, surprising energy, and heroic fixity
of purpose.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
